{"question":"How do gas stations get away with selling drug paraphernalia like bowls and grinders ? Edit : Not sure if it 's bowl or pipe , I 'm not very familiar with that kind of stuff . Sorry if I was wrong . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Because there 's nothing about a bowl or a grinder that 's inherently tied to illegal drug usage . You could be using them for tobacco , for all they know ! It 's the same reason head shops can exist . Until it 's coated in marijuana residue , a bowl is not necessarily paraphernalia .","Because they are n't inherently for smoking marijuana , they are able to be used for smoking tobacco , and some people really do use them for that . And because those people exist and because the problem is largely too small to worry about because there are dozen of work - arounds , no one bothers to change the laws .","Cracked has a very good article I am linking to explain it . Basically it 's because it could be legit . But most likely not . URL_0"],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not legal for gas stations to sell drug paraphernalia, which includes items like pipes, bongs, and grinders that are primarily used for consuming illegal drugs. However, some gas stations may still sell these items because they can be used for other purposes as well, such as grinding herbs for cooking or tobacco for smoking. In these cases, the gas station may argue that they are not intending for the items to be used for illegal purposes, and they are simply selling them as everyday products. \nIt's worth noting that the laws regarding the sale of drug paraphernalia vary by state and country, and it's possible that some gas stations may be breaking the law by selling these items. If you have concerns about a gas station selling drug paraphernalia, you can contact your local authorities or speak to the management of the gas station."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"what are the facial differences between men and women ? Just as an example here , if a head was found with no hair \/ eyebrows \/ eye lashes , how can the gender be found ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Sexual Dimorphism - Some species of animals exhibit differences between sexes so that an individual of that species can fulfil they 're reproductive and survival requirements relative to they 're species . the differences can vary for different species and there is no set characteristic for males or females . i.e. in mammals ( particularly social mammals ) males tends to be larger and stronger and physically better adapted to aggression and conflict , females tend to be better suited to child rearing ( before I get hate mail of Feminazis this is biology , not sociology ) . In Insects Females tend to be larger and better suited to child rearing , where males tend to be simply used sperm production . But back to your original question , what are the facial differences between men and women ? Sexual selection seems to be one of the key factors in later human development . determine the fundamental characteristics of each sex based on the needs and requirement of the opposite sex . For example , men tend to be larger , stronger and broader shoulders ; conversely women have wider hips , are shorter and have a higher fat to muscle ratios . These Characteristics are indicative that men historically have been considered the better fighters and women he better child carers , and in purely reproductive terms would have influenced the sexual selection of either sex , in laments terms men with more masculine features are more sexually desirable , and women with more feminine features are more sexually desirable . ( generally speaking ) However these selection characteristics have also influenced other arbitrary features that we have associated with better mates . I.e. men having wider , squarer jaw lines , and females having the converse . Women having \" softer \" facial features and men having \" harder \" facial features . This is n't an exact science and I based on generalizations , which in turn are based on social perceptions . So a forensic investigator in the situation you provided would have to used assumptions to determine the difference . However I do think there are certain aspects that are absolute , like nose to eye width ratios and so on .","Men in general have hard and rugged facial features , while women tend to have soft and smooth facial features . Testosterone has the effect of making men more aggressive than woman , leading to a more \" angry - looking \" facial expression . To me , this has a lot to do with the curvature of features and the bone structure . Although , I have no scientific data to go off of . This is just from my experience .","That a suspicious , specific , and creepy example sir"],"chatgpt_answers":["There are several differences between the facial features of men and women that can help to determine their gender. Here are a few examples: \n1. Men tend to have stronger and more defined jawlines, while women tend to have softer and rounder jawlines. \n2. Men tend to have thicker eyebrows, while women tend to have thinner eyebrows. \n3. Men tend to have larger noses, while women tend to have smaller noses. \n4. Men tend to have a larger distance between their eyes, while women tend to have a smaller distance between their eyes. \nIf you were trying to determine the gender of a person whose head was found with no hair, eyebrows, or eye lashes, you could look at these facial features to help you make a guess. It's important to note, however, that these are generalizations and there can be overlap between the facial features of men and women. It's also possible for someone to have facial features that don't match the typical expectations for their gender, so it's important to be mindful of this when trying to determine someone's gender."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
