The difference between 1080i and 720p is not as great as people think.  This is because HD can use more pixels per inch, which translates to more detail at each individual pixel.  This means there are fewer pixels to pick up any slight visible movement or flickering.  The justification behind HD over SD is that it's higher resolution and they're both compressed.\nYou're half right.
