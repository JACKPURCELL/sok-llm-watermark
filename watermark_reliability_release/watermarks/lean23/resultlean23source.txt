 later, he heard a loud thud and felt a burning sensation in his right eye.
"I didn't see anything," he said. "All I saw was a flash of light, and then it went away."
The next thing Wyatt knew, he was lying on the ground with his face covered in blood.
"I couldn't tell if I was alive or dead," he said. "I just kept saying, 'Help me, help me.'"
His friend called 911, and paramedics arrived within minutes. Wyatt was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with a fractured skull and lacerations all over his body.
"I've never been so scared in my life," he said. "It's scary when you don't know what's going on."
The incident has left Wyatt in a lot of pain, but he's determined to stay positive and keep moving forward.
"I'm not going to let this get me down," he said.
