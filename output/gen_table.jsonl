But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round.

The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area.

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been", "baseline_completion": " run.

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because", "baseline_completion": " it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem.

The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict", "baseline_completion": " large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn", "baseline_completion": " a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity).

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit", "baseline_completion": " stocks harder than bonds.

{"idx": 29, "truncated_input": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that", "baseline_completion": " as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson.

{"idx": 34, "truncated_input": "No, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself. On March 28, 2014, in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Pope Francis publicly kneeled before a priest and confessed his sins for about three minutes.\nPresident Trump thinks he can do a lot of things just because he is president. He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest.

{"idx": 45, "truncated_input": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile", "baseline_completion": " the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms.

And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking.

It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice \u201cAccidents Will Happen,\u201d on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on \u201cI Still Have That Other Girl,\u201d which he also wrote with Bacharach, \u2013 really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, \u201cHe\u2019s Given Me Things,\u201d from the new disc.\nCostello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying \u201cthis is the first night,\u201d re-started it dramatically better.

Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic.

Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive.

But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads.

{"idx": 67, "truncated_input": "For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The grueling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of credentialed scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.\nNow some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvoc", "baseline_completion": "ates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it.

In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December\u2014the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact\u2014IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston Dynamics is the real celebrity of the bunch. After acquiring six robotics companies in six days, Google took a couple of days off before announcing this major acquisition. The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah.

{"idx": 77, "truncated_input": "On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody\u2019s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft\u2019s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company\u2019s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company\u2019s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn\u2019t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn\u2019t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that\u2019s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that.\n\"We have accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential.

{"idx": 78, "truncated_input": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data", "baseline_completion": " Governance effort.

She sat down recently to talk about language barriers, cabin fever and readjusting to life in east Sacramento.\nQ: Between orphanage work in Zimbabwe and Guatemala and clinic work in Bolivia, you\u2019re no stranger to long flights. How did that come about?\nA: I\u2019ve always enjoyed traveling, and then once I became a nurse, to be able to use that career overseas was really neat to me. What intrigued me about Mercy Ships is it\u2019s a fully run hospital \u2013 you have a lot of equipment, you have a lot of medications. It\u2019s a lot of what I get to do here, over there.\nI am a Christian, and I think a lot of it has to do with seeing how God\u2019s heart breaks when people are broken and poor. So much that you see is diseases of poverty.\nQ: In August, you were scheduled to join a Mercy Ships crew in Benin in West Africa, but the service was canceled due to a possible Ebola case. Months later, your own hospital became a designated Ebola treatment center, and you took part in the preparedness efforts. Would you have considered going overseas to provide care during the outbreak if given the chance?\nA: Had I been signed up with an Ebola team, I wouldn\u2019t have been opposed. I enjoy the risk. I think that\u2019s part of why I became a nurse, because there\u2019s always those risks out there. When that came up, I decided to not be scared and to take more education and learn more about Ebola. For me, it was just a decision of, I\u2019m a nurse, and I have risks even at UC Davis in Sacramento, and that\u2019s why we learn to protect ourselves.\nQ: You said you had a much heavier patient load and more limited resources on the ship than you do in Sacramento. What did you learn on this trip that you\u2019ll bring back to UCD?\nA: In the ward, there were 15 patients at a time with five nurses and five translators. There were people on the guitar and singing, and kids running around. It was a very different environment for me. I had to calculate my antibiotics and draw them up and mix them. It was just a stretch for me as a nurse, to need to focus on something, but also learn an art of nursing where I am appreciating and valuing the relationships of the Malagasy people.... Just challenging my mind to see that I can function differently, and to bring that back to the burn unit is huge.\nQ: Working in the oral and facial ward, you said you saw a lot of patients with physical obstructions that had long been neglected, such as large dental tumors or cleft palates. What is life like for them after surgery?\nA: When you have a pimple and it feels like the end of the world, imagine missing a nose or having a tumor that\u2019s out to there (gestures to a point several inches from her face). A lot of our patients lose their families, or their spouses will leave them. They are outcasts from society, so this gives them confidence.

{"idx": 88, "truncated_input": "Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called cellular vehicle-to-everything (or C-V2X for short), uses wireless signals to share road data, such as a car's location or the color of a traffic light, with other vehicles.\nFord believes it will make cities safer by better informing drivers of their surroundings, and compares the innovation to the invention of the traffic light in the 19th century.\n\"The world's first traffic light [helped] people move through a congested London intersection that had become dangerous for pedestrians due to the popularity of horse-drawn carriages,\" Don Butler, executive director of Ford Connected Vehicle Platform and Product, wrote in a Medium post. \"At Ford, 150 years later, we are excited to continue advancing this type of thinking.\"\nBut critics says the cost of installing the technology will be burdensome for cash-strapped governments. Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too.

{"idx": 93, "truncated_input": "Customers line up to purchase lottery tickets, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, at La Preferida Superdiscount store in Hialeah, Fla.\nFor all the anticipation about whether someone will finally snag the gigantic Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots, the games come down to two things: simple math \u2014 and very long odds.\nBut there are some quirks and surprises about the math equations that likely will soon vault someone into stratospheric wealth after the jackpots grew for months without a winner.\nThe biggest quirk starts with this fact: The advertised $1.6 billion Mega Millions prize \u2014 the world's largest ever lottery jackpot \u2014 and $620 million Powerball prize aren't quite real. That is, those are the amount you'd be paid if you chose an annuity, doled out over 29 years. Nearly every winner opts for cash, which is the amount of money the lottery folks actually have in the bank ready to pay out to the company that would fund the annuity.\nThe cash option is still massive, at $904 million for Mega Millions and $354.3 million for Powerball. But those numbers aren't splayed across billboards and shown in countless mini marts across America.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 1 in 302.5 million \u2014 mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken. But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nThe odds of winning Powerball are 1 in 292.2 million.\nThe odds of winning don't change as jackpots get larger, but the chance that more than one winner will share the prize do. When so many people rush to play as a jackpot soars, the chances increase that two or three tickets \u2014 of the millions of tickets sold \u2014 will match. Of the five largest jackpots awarded in the U.S., three went to multiple winners. The largest single prize went to a 2017 player from Massachusetts who celebrated a $758.7 million Powerball payday.\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.\nLottery officials are quick to point out that the number selection is random, so there's no reason that what hit in the past will be selected again. The game also has changed over the years, so some numbers included weren't always in the mix.\nNot surprisingly, the most Mega Million jackpot winners in the past five years have come from states with the largest populations. New York, with the nation's fourth-largest population, leads with seven winners.

Across the country, Tennessee ranks 15th for the number of farms selling directly to consumers.\n\"We know that many people care about what they eat and want to know where their food comes from,\" said Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton. \"This survey shows what that farmer-to-consumer relationship is worth in Tennessee.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted the survey to get data on the growing and changing local-food sectors across the country. It found that 4,148 Tennessee farms sold food directly to consumers in 2015, and more are getting in the game in a hurry.\n\"The number of farms selling directly to consumers increased more than 500 in the three years since the [last agriculture census],\" said Debra Kenerson, a Tennessee state statistician. \"This shows tremendous growth in a short period of time.\"\nThe farm sales include fresh foods like meat and vegetables but also edible processed foods like bottled milk, cheese, meat, jam, cider, and wine. Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the 'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the", "baseline_completion": " food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that.

{"idx": 100, "truncated_input": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen.\nDoctors are very good at telling us what to do \u2014 but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors\u2019 orders.\nDoctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don\u2019t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don\u2019t get better, and that our health care costs are so high.\nIt is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn\u2019t doing what he is supposed to.\nBad adherence doesn\u2019t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can\u2019t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer \u2014 but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system \u2014 are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help.\nJoe McManus is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he\u2019s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl.\nIn other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. \u201cMy doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,\u201d he said in a recent interview in his apartment. \u201cI had no relationship with her \u2014 except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn\u2019t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.\u201d McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez.\nWhen Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. \u201cHow the hell are you living like this?\u201d Rodriguez blurted out.\nIt made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load \u2014 he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor\u2019s appointments on his own.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he follows all of his doctor\u2019s advice. He\u2019s no longer doing crack, but he\u2019s still drinking \u2014 several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend\u2019s bar. He loves the bar \u2014 it\u2019s his entire social network.\nBut his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: \u201cYou can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,\u201d she told him. \u201cI never have to tell you if I ever have one,\u201d McManus thought to himself.\nRodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very honest with me,\u201d Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a doctor,\u201d he said.\nThe Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health \u2014 a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners\u2019 strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers.\nThe new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J.\nThere are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits.\nBut nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. \u201cGiven the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,\u201d said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. \u201cEspecially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don\u2019t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,\u201d she said.\nPACT\u2019s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients\u2019 use of appropriate medicines rose \u2014 they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people", "baseline_completion": " who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine.

{"idx": 108, "truncated_input": "France is in a difficult position. It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis", "baseline_completion": ", France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms.

{"idx": 113, "truncated_input": "Why do CEOs need extravagant perks even when they are firing staff and pleading for taxpayer bailouts? It may just be in their makeup, experts say. It takes arrogance and narcissism to become leader of a Fortune 500 company. Those same traits, however, have become their undoing during the deepest recession in decades.\nU.S. President Barack Obama has noticed, telling reporters on Thursday he was outraged by a New York State report that $18.4 billion in Wall Street bonuses were paid in 2008 as taxpayers rescued the crumbling financial system. \"That is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful,\" Obama said.\nNew York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating Wall Street bonuses, welcomed Obama&apos;s comments. \"While Wall Street melted down, top executives believed that, unlike the rest of the country, they still deserved huge bonuses,\" Cuomo said.\nFor Bob Monks, a former executive who has written nine books on corporate governance, the reason is that the rich and powerful simply love their toys. \"It&apos;s a boy thing. Sort of, &apos;Mine&apos;s bigger than yours.&apos; It&apos;s really childish,\" said Monks, a shareholder rights activist and the subject of a book called \"A Traitor to His Class.\"\nMonks related a story about flying on someone&apos;s corporate jet. The host was devastated when, upon landing, he saw that while he planned for a limo to be waiting at the airport another captain of industry had a helicopter take him to town. \"I thought my guy was going to die.... It&apos;s entirely about people&apos;s self-image.\"\nLongtime advocates of shareholder rights were handed a gift in November when Detroit auto executives flew to Washington on corporate jets to ask for billions of dollars in taxpayer money, sparking a public outrage.\nMore recently, it became known that former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain spent $1.2 million remodeling his office last year, including $1,405 for a trash can. Merrill Lynch is owned by Bank of America, which consumed $45 billion of taxpayer money through bailouts.\nThen on Tuesday, Citigroup canceled plans to buy a $50 million executive jet after a White House rebuke.\n\"People don&apos;t become head of Merrill Lynch without having a certain sense of self-importance. Once they arrive at that position, they have all kinds of toadies tell them what geniuses they are, then of course they begin to feel their lifelong feelings of self-importance have been confirmed,\" said Charles Goodstein, a psychoanalyst and professor at New York University School of Medicine.\nDefenders of executive perks say generous compensation is needed to retain talent. Sometimes it&apos;s jets but can also include home security systems, country club memberships, sports tickets and financial advice. The value of these benefits is considered income, so CEOs also sometimes get another perk: company help in paying their taxes. \"I was CEO of a bank once and it&apos;s not rocket science. You need the same skill set as somebody running a hardware store in a medium-sized town,\" Monks said.\nSteve Thel, a former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Fordham Law School, blames compliant board members who often come from the same privileged world and can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for attending", "baseline_completion": " a few meetings each year. \"It&apos;s endemic to the system.

Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow.

Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don\u2019t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce \u201cdormant, not dead,\u201d since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta\u2019s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love\u2014love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food.

You can see what\u2019s growing via the garden\u2019s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever\u2019s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed\u00ae (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes.

{"idx": 126, "truncated_input": "In the past 11 months, Mauti has had to rely on his words unlike any other time in his life. Penn State\u2019s leading tackler went from being a quiet, unquestioned leader to a harsh-talking student representative nearly overnight.\nWhen a scandal and the ensuing fallout threatened to tear apart his team, all Mauti could fight back with were his words.\nTo Penn State fans, Michael Mauti was unknown in 2008.\nHis dad, Rich, had played for the Nittany Lions and went on to his own successful run in the NFL. His brother, Patrick, was a junior on the Nittany Lions. The youngest Mauti was just the new kid \u2014 Pat\u2019s little brother \u2014 in the No. 42 jersey.\nHe introduced himself eight games into the season. With Michigan in town and threatening to take a two-possession lead at Beaver Stadium, Mauti flew down the field on kickoff coverage in the first quarter and exploded into Michigan return man Sam McGuffie.\nThe football popped free, and although the Wolverines recovered it, a psychological blow had been dealt. The packed stadium was rocking and the Penn State sideline drew sudden inspiration from Mauti\u2019s jackhammer hit.\nThe Nittany Lions then rattled off 39 unanswered points to secure a 46-17 win.\nIt took a hit of that caliber to spark a young Mauti\u2019s love of the game.\nAlthough Rich Mauti played seven seasons in the NFL, he wouldn\u2019t let his sons step on a football field until they were in seventh grade. In Michael\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t start playing until eighth grade.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the youngest Mauti to be put off by football.\nSo Mauti, the smallest kid on the team, let the season play out. Soon, an unwilling participant became the fiercest of competitors on the freshman team at Mandeville (La.) High School.\nHe started the season as a quarterback but soon found himself making plays on kickoff coverage.\nIt\u2019s not that Mauti intends to injure opponents. He plays within the rules. But he won\u2019t deny that football is a violent game and being the player to initiate contact is Mauti\u2019s specialty.\nIf an opponent remembers Mauti\u2019s number after a hit and has second thoughts about touching the football for the rest of the game, Mauti\u2019s made a huge impact by his own standards.\n\u201cThe feeling of the hit. The feeling of delivering a blow, it\u2019s just \u2014 There\u2019s something about it,\u201d Mauti said.\nIt was the worst feeling of his playing career \u2014 laying on his back on the Beaver Stadium grass, staring up at a blue sky knowing it was happening all over again.\nMauti had torn an anterior cruciate ligament before, so he knew pretty quickly when his left leg buckled during the first quarter of the 2011 Eastern Illinois game that his left leg was shot before he even hit the ground.\nAfter sutting out the entire 2009 season concentrating on rehabilitating his right knee, Mauti came back with a vengeance in 2010. He finished fifth on the team with 57 tackles.\nAn expanded on-field role would have to wait, however, following the early season injury to his left knee last season.\nMauti got luckier the second time around. When he was injured in 2009, he contracted a nasty case of strep throat. He lost nearly 30 pounds and couldn\u2019t eat normally for weeks. Last fall, Mauti was able to stay relatively healthy except for the knee injury. He was able to concentrate on healing after his surgery and took a better approach to his rehab having gone through it just months before.\nThen-defensive coordinator Tom Bradley wanted to keep his star linebacker involved with day-to-day operations. So Mauti became an extra coach, going so far as to call the majority of the defenses in the TicketCity Bowl after Bradley was promoted to interim head coach.\nIt helped having counsel from former Nittany Lions such as Jerome Hayes, Brennan Coakley and Sean Lee - who had been in Mauti\u2019s situation, battling back from knee injuries.\nBeyond two major knee injuries, Mauti has racked up the bumps and bruises one would expect of a brute who plays every snap with reckless abandon, thriving on collisions.\nMauti appeared in 11 games in 2010 and wouldn\u2019t let a sprained ankle suffered against Iowa or a separated shoulder courtesy of Ohio State to keep him away from football.\nMauti learned over a tumultuous summer that he could take on an even greater role for a squad desperately in need of vocal leader.\nWhen the NCAA came down on Penn State with a four-year bowl ban to go along with a $60 million fine and serious scholarship reductions, Mauti and teammate Michael Zordich got together with a plan to combat the NCAA\u2019s harshest penalty.\nThe sanctions gave any Penn State player a free chance to transfer out of the program without giving up a year of eligibility. Some chose to do just that, and other college programs began contacting Penn State players, some even coming to campus on recruiting trips.\nMauti and Zordich took it personally. The duo made their way to Coach Bill O\u2019Brien after the NCAA penalties were announced, and the next day made a statement outside of the team\u2019s practice complex that Penn State players would stick together.\nFor the most part, the Nittany Lions have.\nMauti said he was honored to eulogize Joe Paterno at a memorial service following the longtime coach\u2019s death in January. Speaking last in a line of players, each representing a decade Paterno in which coached, Mauti took to the lectern in the Bryce Jordan Center with no notes and spoke from the heart.\nHe told the story of his initial recruitment. Mauti\u2019s family didn\u2019t expect him to commit on the spot to Paterno, but that\u2019s what happened. Mauti remembered Paterno giving him flack for getting kicked out of a drill for fighting as a freshman.\n\u201c\u2018Hey, your dad used to act like he was tough, too, trying to fight people all the time,\u2019\u201d Mauti said in his best high-pitched impression of Paterno.\nPat Fitzgerald\u2019s eyes are trained to watch football and immediately evaluate.\nWhen the Northwestern coach dissects an opposing team\u2019s defense, his eyes go to the linebackers first. Fitzgerald, himself a college football hall of famer who played the position, sees no weaknesses in Mauti\u2019s game.\nMauti won\u2019t dwell on his past. He won\u2019t allow the fear of being injured to creep into his mind.\nHe won\u2019t let the negative white noise, the criticism of his team or school by outside talking heads, distract him. Like he did this summer, when other coaches were on Penn State\u2019s campus, looking to lure Nittany Lion players way, Mauti will give them an earful. He\u2019ll do everything in his power to keep opposing coaches away.\nIf that means he has to talk, so be it. Mauti said he would rather hit someone between the sidelines.\nHe\u2019ll throw himself into Northwestern players with explosive zeal. He\u2019ll get up off the pile of players and high step his way back to the Penn State sideline.\nMimicking his big-hit celebration at his seat in the Lasch Football Building, Mauti bounces both of his legs simultaneously", "baseline_completion": " so his knees come up above the table where he\u2019s sitting.\nMauti\u2019s presence is heavily requested these days.

This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEx librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages.

Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics.

Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception.

{"idx": 133, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious.\nWhere the science-fiction genre is concerned, it\u2019s not hard to at the very least appreciate the ambition of the storytelling. It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals \u2013 like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There\u2019s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious \u2013 albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It\u2019s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable \u201cawakening\u201d material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt\u2019s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart \u2013 which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story. These are the three surviving members of the Abrasax family -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) \u2013 and the sons and daughter of the woman whom Jupiter Jones is a genetic equal. Each of them has a personal desire to take control of the Earth \u2013 which is alternately described as being extremely valuable and just a single piece of a much larger business \u2013 but also each take their own place doing more harm to the movie than good. Kalique winds up being mostly useless to the story, simply providing huge amounts of exposition and then disappearing; Titus merely feels like a stall in the narrative, serving as what is really a fairly pointless obstacle; and Balem simply feels overcooked in every sense, with Redmayne giving a highly bizarre, scenery-chewing performance full of needless affectation that makes him stick out like a sore thumb (really making you wonder what kind of off-base directions he was being given by the Wachowskis). As Jupiter Ascending\u2019s plot encounters these characters, the film begins to degrade faster and faster, exploring needless and unnecessary elements of the sci-fi world that do more subtraction than addition.\nAt this point in their careers, Andy and Lana Wachowski have become better known for their visual flash and style, and it serves the movie well. Their flair is apparent from the costume and makeup work (the idea of DNA splicing works magic in this department) to the production design, and it all serves to provide Jupiter Ascending with a unique feel (even when it wears references to movies like Brazil on its sleeve). Immense credit also goes to the visual effects teams, who not only render some fantastic air battles and spaceships, but also expansive alien environments that do their part to make the audience feel like they\u2019re being taken to a different world. All of this spectacle doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt\u2019s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it", "baseline_completion": " is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it\u2019s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads.

I wanted to carry on learning and this feels like a job whereas if I'd gone back to university it would have felt like a step backwards.\"\nFormer secondary school teaching assistant Kirsty Norris, 25, said: \"You see the reality of life in a school.

Sanger was a controversial figure\u2014and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early '40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), meanwhile, seeks to interfere with services covered by private insurance. By cutting off federal funds for insurance companies that cover abortions\u2014even when the tax dollars aren't put toward abortion coverage\u2014his bill would deny women the legal right to an abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It would also impose tax penalties on those whose insurance offers such coverage.\nIn Arizona, families are facing further potential threats as the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced several anti-women's-health initiatives this year. HB 2384 would make Planned Parenthood newly ineligible for the Arizona Working Poor Tax Credit. HB 2416 would cause additional obstacles to abortion access, including changing the definition of \"surgical abortion\" to include abortion by pill, which could cut off rural women from abortion services. HB 2443 would infringe upon patient privacy by denying care to women who refuse to disclose the reasons behind their decision to abort.\nA century ago, Margaret Sanger witnessed tragedies that resulted from unintended pregnancies.

A total of 3,698 new and existing houses and condos were sold in the Las Vegas-Paradise metro area in February, according to MDA DataQuick. That\u2019s up 9.8% from January and 10.5% from one year ago. A 5.7% increase from January to February is the average, dating back to 1994, DataQuick said. The February 2010 total was the highest for the month since 2006, when 6,065 homes were sold, but 2% below the 16-year average February sales total.

New home sales totaled 387 in February, up 40% from January and up 20.2% from last year, but it was one of the slowest February sales totals in DataQuick\u2019s 16 years of records, second only to last year. The decline in foreclosure resales and the increase in new home sales helped the median price increase from January, but only slightly.

He will miss the remainder of the season.\nThe Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation.\n\"Man, I have no idea it is,\" said Winker. \"I know my shoulder hurts. That\u2019s all I know.\"\nWinker said the pain was \"off and on\" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw.\nOn first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths.

{"idx": 140, "truncated_input": "Rafael Nadal became the first man to win eight titles at the same Grand Slam tournament after beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the French Open final on Sunday.\nIf Rafael Nadal truly was going to be challenged, if his bid for an unprecedented eighth French Open championship would be slowed even a bit, this might have been the moment.\nLeading by a set and a break 70 minutes into Sunday's final against David Ferrer, another generally indefatigable Spaniard, Nadal faced four break points in one game. The last was a 31-stroke exchange, the match's longest, capped when Nadal absorbed Ferrer's strong backhand approach and transformed it into a cross-court backhand passing shot.\nFerrer glared at the ball as it flew past and landed in a corner, then smiled ruefully. What else was there to do? Dealing with Nadal's defence-to-offence on red clay is a thankless task. His rain-soaked 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Ferrer on was Nadal's record 59th win in 60 matches at the French Open and made him the only man with eight titles at any Grand Slam tournament.\n\"I never like to compare years, but it's true that this year means something very special for me,\" Nadal said, alluding to the way he managed to come back from a left knee injury that sidelined him for about seven months.\n\"When you have a period of time like I had,\" he added, \"you realize that you don't know if you will have the chance to be back here with this trophy another time.\"\nBut he does it, year after year.\nHe won four French Opens in a row from 2005-08, and another four in a row from 2010-13.\n\"Rafael was better than me,\" said Ferrer, who had won all 18 sets he'd played the past two weeks to reach his first Grand Slam final at age 31. \"He didn't make mistakes.\"\nA week past his 27th birthday, Nadal now owns 12 major trophies in all \u2014 including two from Wimbledon, one each from the U.S. Open and Australian Open \u2014 to eclipse Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver and equal Roy Emerson for the third-most in history. Nadal trails only Roger Federer's 17 and Pete Sampras' 14.\n\"Winning 17 Grand Slam titles, that's miles away,\" Nadal said with his typical humility. \"I'm not even thinking about it.\"\nThis was Nadal's first major tournament after a surprising second-round loss at Wimbledon last June. Since rejoining the tour in February, he is 43-2 with seven titles and two runner-up finishes. He's won his past 22 matches.\n\"For me, it's incredible,\" said Toni Nadal, Rafael's uncle and coach. \"When I think of all that Rafael has done, I don't understand it.\"\nLet's be plain: No one, perhaps not even Ferrer himself, expected Nadal to lose Sunday.\nThat's because of Nadal's skill on clay, in general, and at Roland Garros, in particular, but also because of how Ferrer had fared against his friend and countryman \u2014 and video-game competitor \u2014 in the past.\nFerrer entered Sunday 4-19 against Nadal. On clay, Nadal had 16 consecutive victories over Ferrer, whose only head-to-head win on the surface came the first time they played, in July 2004, when Nadal was 18.\nNadal had yet to make his French Open debut then, missing it that year because of a broken left foot. On May 23, 2005, Nadal played his first match at Roland Garros, beating Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-1 on Court 1, known as the \"bullring\" because of its oval shape.\nAnd so began the reign.\nNadal won a record 31 consecutive matches at the French Open until the fourth round in 2009, when Robin Soderling beat him. In 2010, Nadal started a new streak, which currently stands at 28.\nThere was occasional shakiness this year. Nadal lost the first set of each of his first two matches, and was pushed to a tiebreaker to begin his third. His fourth match, a straight-set win against No. 15 Kei Nishikori, \"was a major step forward,\" Nadal said. Still, he barely edged No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic in a thrilling semifinal that lasted more than 4 1/2 hours and ended 9-7 in the fifth set Friday.\nBy any measure, that match was far more enjoyable to take in than the final, akin to dining on a filet mignon accompanied by a well-aged bottle of Bordeaux \u2014 each bite and sip rich, textured \u2014 one day, then grabbing a hot dog and can of soda from a street vendor 48 hours later.\nUnder a leaden sky that eventually would release a steady shower from the second set on, Ferrer felt nerves at the outset, he acknowledged later. But after the players traded early breaks, Ferrer held for a 3-2 lead.\nThat's when Nadal took over, winning seven games in a row and 12 of 14 to render the ultimate result pretty clear. It was as if he simply decided, \"Enough is enough.\" His court coverage was impeccable, as usual, showing no signs of any problems from that left knee, which was supported by a band of white tape. His lefty forehand whips were really on-target, accounting for 19 of his 35 winners and repeatedly forcing errors from Ferrer.\nWhen Nadal did have lapses, he admonished himself, once slapping his forehead with his right palm after pushing a lob wide. But what's demoralizing for opponents is the way Nadal slams the door when they have openings, then rushes through when he gets the slightest chance.\nHe was at his relentless best on key points, including those four break chances for Ferrer at 3-1 in the second set. Immediately after, Nadal broke to 5-1 on a forehand winner down the line.\nAs Nadal prepared to serve in the next game, a man wearing a white mask and carrying a fiery flare jumped out of the stands nearby. The intruder quickly was shoved to the ground by one security guard, while another went to protect Nadal.\n\"I felt a little bit scared at the first moment,\" Nadal said, \"because I didn't see what's going on.\"\nIt happened within a few minutes of other actions by protesters, including chanting from the upper deck that briefly delayed play. Police said seven people were held for questioning.\nNadal got broken in that game, then broke back right away to take the second set.\nThe third set was similar to the first. It was 3-all, then suddenly over. Nadal took the last three games, ending the match with a forehand winner before dropping his racket and falling on his back, leaving a rust-colored smudge on his white shirt and flecks of clay on his stubbled cheeks.

The median sale price in June was $189,000, up 6 percent from $139,000 a year ago, but slightly down from $212,500 in April, the highest level in 1.5 years.\nA declining inventory is also fueling a rise in prices. The number of condos for sale in Southeast Volusia fell 22 percent to 462 in June, the lowest level in at least 4-1/2 years, from 594 a year ago.\nA Winter Park developer started building the proposed nine-story, 19-unit Vizcaya condo project in 2007, but abandoned the project the following year.\nThat left a development site where 193 pilings had already been pounded into the earth, a slab poured and blocks laid for the first-floor walls. The property has remained in that state ever since.\nEckall Development bought the property in December for $1.1 million, according to Volusia County property records. The existing infrastructure was tested and is sound, said Lee Allen, a company principal.\nAllen and Ken Eckelkamp, the founders of Eckall Development, say they are already familiar with Southeast Volusia having previously worked for JMC Communities, which built the 310-unit Minorca condo complex at the north tip of New Smyrna Beach between 2002 and 2007 and the 39-unit Seacrest condo complex in 2007 at 4071 S.

Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend.

From your phone, computer, tablet, credit cards, travel records and more. We know they are doing this because of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nJohn Oliver traveled to Moscow where Snowden, wanted by the U.S government, has asylum for the next three years. There he interviewed Snowden in an attempt to find out why more Americans don\u2019t care about the government spying on their personal lives.\nBased on Snowden\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s spying activities, here are five basic questions every American should ask themselves about the NSA surveillance program.\n1. Do you want the government to collect your data (including your naked pictures)?\nAccording to Oliver, Pew Research found that 46 percent of Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance. Why? It\u2019s too complicated and technical to try to trace the life cycle of a text message. Hilariously Oliver tries to put the issue into terms Americans will care about \u2014 whether or not the government has access to your naked pictures. Once everyday folks heard the argument in those terms, they got interested in the debate pretty fast.\n\u201cI did this [released secret NSA spying information] to give the American people the chance to decide for themselves what kind of government they want to have,\u201d Snowden tells Oliver.\nDo you want a government that hoards your most scandalous communications?\n2. Why did the government lie about its spying activity?\nOn June 1, 2015, key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire, including the controversial Section 215 provision, which has been interpreted by a FISA Court to mean that the government has the authority to collect comprehensive data on its citizens.\nPrior to the Snowden revelations about programs like PRISM, American government officials \u2014 including President Obama \u2014 said the government was collecting only basic phone and internet records, like when a call was made and to whom (metadata), rather than the actual content of the conversation. Snowden proved that\u2019s just not true.\nThe Snowden documents showed that the government was collecting and storing the content of Americans\u2019 communications too, like emails, phone calls, internet searches and text and chat messages, rather than just basic call record information.\nWorse yet, it\u2019s not just being looked at; it\u2019s being stored in monster government data centers in Utah, in case it needs to be looked at in the future. So if you want to play a semantics game, they aren\u2019t actively looking at it, just saving a copy in case they need to later. Does that make you feel any better about it?\n3. Can you trust the government with this kind of power?\nMobile phone data provides an incredibly detailed account of your life \u2014 your location, who you call, emails, text messages, internet searches, online shopping habits. Combine that level of detailed data contained in your credit card records, home and work emails and internet searches, and that\u2019s a pretty freaky accurate representation of who you are, where you\u2019ve been, with whom and what you were doing. But not totally accurate.\nYour phone data might put you in a mall food court at the same time as a terrorist, but does that mean you\u2019re a terrorist too? What if you just both happen to love Orange Julius and soft pretzels?\nNow, imagine in the future the government charges you with a crime. Any crime, really. Doesn\u2019t matter which. For belonging to the wrong religion. For being too friendly with someone the government doesn\u2019t like. Happens all the time around the world. Rather than the government having to collect evidence about your crime to prove your guilt, it\u2019ll already have a pile of information on you it can use however it chooses. No warrant. Nada.\nWe might be cool with all of this surveillance capability being used against the terrorists, but what if it\u2019s turned on Americans one day?\nSo do you trust them?\n4. How do we balance privacy and safety?\nThe Patriot Act was conceived amidst the fear following the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. But even one of the primary authors of the Patriot Act, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, testified that the legislation was never intended to authorize the bulk collection and storage of the communications of U.S. citizens and that its powers should be reined in when the Patriot Act is reauthorized this summer.\nGovernment officials argue that this kind of surveillance is critical for fighting terrorists and those who would do America and Americans harm. That sounds totally reasonable and fair. But with programs like PRISM and other surveillance activity Americans have no idea is going on, how can we have a debate and balance the idea of security against the idea of liberty?\nHow much privacy are we willing to give up for less security risk?\n5. Are you on a watch list?\nAt the end of the interview, Snowden gives John Oliver a pretty ominous warning \u2014 that by interviewing him, Oliver is likely now on a very serious, very scary U.S. government watch list. The idea of a watch list is discussed in more frightening detail in the Academy Award-winning documentary about Snowden, Citizenfour.\nAmericans are put on watch lists all the time, which brings increased scrutiny of communications, increased surveillance and, when traveling out of the country, often problems getting your passport cleared across international borders without intense questioning. But how do you know if you\u2019ve done something to raise the government\u2019s suspicions about your activity? Am I on a watch list just for writing this article? Are you for reading it? How would we know? It\u2019s a secret.\nThe principles of transparency and checks and balances the U.S. government is founded on demand that", "baseline_completion": " citizens be informed about these kinds of government activities. Whether you view Snowden as a hero or a traitor, as he says, now you know what your government is doing in our name. Do you care? Does it bother you?

What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case. A lot of cloud providers are focused on helping enterprises rather than SMBs. Luckily, there are some cloud providers that cater specifically to SMB customers.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about SMB cloud migrations and how to choose the right cloud provider to meet your company\u2019s needs, be sure to register for the upcoming webinar titled \u201cHow to Know if Your Cloud Decision is Right for Your SMB.\u201d The webinar, presented by Ed Dryer, senior technology strategist at Steadfast, will take place on Tuesday, August", "baseline_completion": " 22, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. EDT.\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of public, hybrid and private clouds for SMBs; learn the operational and cost benefits of virtualization; hear what is driving SMBs today to make cloud investments; and understand how cloud services complement business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) services, managed security, and on-demand infrastructure.

{"idx": 157, "truncated_input": "On Jan. 15, nine of 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announcing their resignation, effectively dissolving the board.\nIt was an act of protest against an administration with little appetite for the methodical approach the board has brought to national park management for decades. And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it\u2019s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it\u2019s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested\u2014perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department\u2019s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department \u201cwelcomes\u201d the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn\u2019t fall under the board\u2019s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board\u2019s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we\u2019d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them. So we waited one, two, three, four months. There was no contract (to allow us to continue our work), no understanding of when a Park Service director would be appointed. In early October, I wrote a letter to Secretary Zinke explaining how the board wanted to meet to inform the new administration of what we envisioned to build a better park system in the 21st century, and to hear what their vision was. We got no answer. I pestered and pestered, and in mid-November got a one-sentence email from someone saying the secretary was very busy. That\u2019s when we realized they were just running out the clock until our terms expired in May.\nHCN: Why did you decide to resign rather than try to influence the direction of the agency from within?\nTK: When you\u2019re on permanent hold, at some time you\u2019ve gotta hang up. There\u2019s no one to talk to but yourselves. By nine of us resigning, we felt we\u2019d be able to get the microphone briefly to at least talk to the American people about climate change, about preserving the natural diversity of wildlife, about making sure underrepresented minorities not only come to the parks but are employees there. All these things we think are important. We may be disappointed with the Department of the Interior, but we are not discouraged. Every single one of us will continue the fight to promote and protect our public lands.\nHCN: Given that your action is part of a larger pattern of resignations and layoffs at the Park Service, are you concerned about the agency\u2019s future?\nTK: Of course we\u2019re concerned. The secretary proposed a 13 percent budget reduction, which would", "baseline_completion": " all come out of personnel, then claimed he\u2019s going to rebuild infrastructure by raising park entry fees.

She took one last exasperated gulp of air. That\u2019s when paramedics arrived. Far too late.\nLeon\u2019s death reverberated through her family and her community. Her son, a college student in a town two hours away, sees no point in coming home anymore. Her husband is withdrawn and is close to losing his job. Her daughter struggles to understand what happened as she fights off despair and anger recalling all the chaos that revolved around Leon\u2019s last moments on the floor of her home.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s government faced immediate scrutiny after initially reporting that 16 people had died as a result of the storm, which strafed much of the island on Sept. 20. That number more than doubled after President Donald Trump visited in October, when he specifically noted the low death toll. The number kept rising until early December, when authorities said 64 had died.\nThe official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital \u2013 only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.\nThe new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.\nGov. Ricardo Rossells\u2019s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.\nAfter pressure from Congress and statistical analyses from news organizations that put the death toll at higher than 1,000, Rossells enlisted the help of George Washington University experts to review the government\u2019s death certification process. He promised that \u201cregardless of what the death certificate says,\u201d each death would be inspected closely to ensure a correct tally.\n\u201cThis is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,\u201d Rossells said at a news conference in late February.\nLynn Goldman, dean of GW\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health, expects an initial report to be released in coming weeks. The school\u2019s findings will include the first government-sponsored attempt by researchers and epidemiologists to quantify Hurricane Maria\u2019s deadliness. Experts are assessing statistical mortality data and plan to dive into medical records and to interview family members of those who have passed, though the scope and funding of the deeper investigation is still unclear, as its timing.\nSome cases are obviously storm-related, Goldman said, such as someone dying after a tree branch falls on his head while clearing debris or someone who suffers a heart attack during the storm and was unable to get help. But death certificates bearing the phrase \u201cnatural causes\u201d will require further investigation.\nThe Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico has gone to court in an effort to seek the island\u2019s Department of Health and Demographic Registry\u2019s mortality data for the months since November, the last month information was available. The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics also announced in recent weeks it would perform an independent death count and use subpoena powers to retrieve the data. Spokesman Eric Perlloni Alayon said in a statement the government is still trying to verify the death toll and does not plan to release any new data.\nThe Harvard researchers reported that there are several reasons the death toll in Puerto Rico has been drastically underestimated. Every disaster-related death, they said, must be confirmed by the government\u2019s Forensic Sciences Institute, which requires that bodies by brought to San Juan or that a medical examiner travel to the local municipality. And it can be difficult to track indirect deaths from a worsening of chronic conditions due to the storm.\nMany families here are awaiting clarity on what happened to their loved ones when \u201cnatural causes\u201d became the only explanation. That is what was written on Leon\u2019s death certificate the morning a local law enforcement official brought the document to the family home. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice\u2019s Yamil Juarbe said in a statement it is customary for local officials in these cases to review bodies for any signs of trauma and talk to relatives to learn about the deceased\u2019s medical history. That information is collected and sent to the central office of the Institute of Forensic Sciences.\nLeon\u2019s family said her name was misspelled on the death certificate and her death was incorrectly attributed to diabetes; they say she did not have any known chronic diseases. Officials later corrected the documents, but it was one of several indignities and oversights the family tracked.\nLeon\u2019s demise began with a virus, and the first signs appeared as she was delivering donations to families of Boy Scouts who had lost their homes in another city, Humacao. During Thanksgiving week, Leon had planned a feast for her family but felt too sick to finish the turkey. She seasoned the bird and a local bakery roasted it. Then the vomiting and diarrhea struck her.\nIt took 20 minutes to obtain cell reception and call 911 from their metropolitan Caguas neighborhood. It took another 10 minutes, records show, before the ambulance could reach Leon\u2019s home because of road congestion and failing traffic lights. Paramedics tried to revive Leon using CPR, but she was already dead upon their arrival. Montanez tried for days to have an autopsy performed, but she said no government agency or private medical organization had the capacity to conduct one.\nMontanez stays awake many nights replaying her mother\u2019s last days.

{"idx": 165, "truncated_input": "I didn\u2019t notice, but I\u2019ve been told George W, Bush delivered his latest speech smoothly, more so than most of his speeches. He has certainly practiced the stay-the-course storyline.\nHow many times have we suffered White House fanfare for a presidential speech that will finally solve the mystery of our foreign policy? How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W. Bush is indeed a broken record, and worse for wear?\nGeorge waved the bloody shirt at Fort Bragg, recalling 9-11 and global terrorists. He again brought forth the well-used and amazingly stupid idea that we will somehow take the war to the terrorists. And yes, he was talking about Iraq.\nThose of us living in the reality-based world must be ever so tiresome to our nifty commander in chief.\nIn the real world, Mr. Bush, young Americans die, are maimed and morally devastated by wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, both conducted without legal or moral justification, and hence without hope. In the real world, Americans, Iraqis and Afghans all suffer a conflict dreamed up by finely fed and well-dressed neoconservatives in air-conditioned Washington suites.\nAt leisurely lunches and late night planning sessions they designed a boutique war to be fought by tin soldiers. I imagine the work, and the finger food, was positively delicious.\nAs he has since his 9-11 raison d\u2019tre, Bush emphasized this week that we shall prevail by taking the war to the \"terrorists.\" This must sound great echoing off the peach and lavender rooms of the administration\u2019s unreality-based world.\nOn the other hand, many great thinkers on military affairs have extensively studied the reality-based world, and thus might be helpful. Sun Tzu, for example. The ancient strategist wrote, \"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\"\nTransfixed by the light of their own brilliance reflecting from pastel-sheened walls and bulletproof windows, the Bush administration hears him not.\nKarl von Clausewitz wrote, \"No one starts a war \u2014 or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so \u2014 without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.\"\nHear, hear! But it seems that the neoconservatives who long envisioned the toppling of the Ba\u2019ath Party, and the emplacement of an administration-friendly Prime Minister in Baghdad as a Do-it-Yourself weekend project, were deafened once again by their own self-congratulatory cheers.\nClausewitz, always trying to help innocent politicians, wryly noted, \"In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.\"\nSir Basil Liddell-Hart, in the mid-1900s, not so long ago, expanded upon Clausewitz in this regard. The old Brit noted, \"Natural hazards, however formidable, are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards. All conditions are more calculable, all obstacles more surmountable than those of human resistance.\"\nAs President, George W. Bush is a public example of a life spent failing to learn from either his betters or his mistakes, refusing to develop empathy when revenge felt better, and avoiding the hard work and self-doubt of personal accountability. He vows to stay the course and exercise his will because without that, he is left alone with his fears of inconsequentiality and too many vengeful ghosts. It\u2019s enough to drive a man to drink, to swear, to cry and crumble.\nThe audience at Bragg was politically controlled and generally pro-Bush, yet the only applause-based interruption of Bush\u2019s speech was apparently the result of a Bush aide\u2019s signaling.\nAmerican service members and their families \u2014 now in the third year of a three-week war driven by a secret Washington establishment geostrategy and fueled by blatant repetitive lies \u2014 have seen their friends and lovers and children in wheelchairs and in coffins.

{"idx": 172, "truncated_input": "Stopping nearsightedness in kids and more.\nThis week, Dr. Sydney Spiesel discusses a way to stop the progression of nearsightedness in kids, a better method of hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause, and new developments in the search for a cause for autism. His column will start appearing a couple of times a month.\nCondition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences. It has long been understood that the condition has a strong genetic component: Nearsighted parents are more likely to have nearsighted children. But recent research has shown that other factors contribute. For example, just as our mothers warned us, there is now evidence that doing close-up work, like reading, seems to promote the condition.\nHow it progresses: The eyeball of a nearsighted person is deeper than the eyeball of a person with normal vision and becomes deeper as nearsightedness progresses. Myopia often begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 8. As children grow, their nearsightedness worsens, continuing to do so long after they have stopped growing taller. Though we know a lot about factors associated with nearsightedness and its progression, we have no good ideas yet about the mechanism. But can we stop it?\nNew research: A recent study by Wei-Han Chua and colleagues at the Singapore National Eye Center elegantly built on older research and successfully used atropine eye drops to treat myopia in children. Atropine is a longer-lasting version of the pupil-dilating drops your doctor uses when you go for an eye exam. Available by prescription in the United States, the drops are mainly used to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) instead of the older treatment, patching, which children often hate.\nDr. Chua and his co-workers studied the progression of nearsightedness in 400 children between 6 and 12 years of age. Half the children were treated with atropine eye drops, and the other half were treated with placebo eye drops. Both kinds of drops were administered nightly to one eye, so the untreated eye could be compared with the treated one. The children were followed for two years. All used eyeglasses to correct their nearsightedness, and because atropine dilates the pupil, the lenses of the glasses self-darkened in bright light, to avoid discomfort for the children whose pupils were dilated.\nFindings: The effects were extraordinary: After two years, on average, the children\u2019s nearsightedness had not progressed in the atropine-treated eyes but had dramatically worsened in the placebo-treated and untreated eyes. Similarly, atropine-treated eyes did not become deeper, while placebo-treated and untreated eyes did. No serious adverse effects were observed in the course of the research.\nConclusion: This is extremely promising. Further work needs to be done to determine the ideal concentration of atropine in the eye drops, to find out how long the treatment needs to last, and if the effects are permanent. Because atropine interferes with close focusing, children will probably need to wear bifocals while they\u2019re using the atropine drops. Much more research must be done to help us understand why nearsightedness develops and progresses. But in the meantime, we may have a way to head off this common problem.\nTreatment: Hormone replacement therapy was introduced in 1941, when the FDA approved the use of estrogen for this purpose. Early on, HRT was prescribed with great enthusiasm. It relieved troublesome symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and, for some women, difficulty in concentration. And HRT (usually estrogen plus a progestin) was shown to improve the bone density of elderly women and decrease their risk for fractures.\nDownside: Time and further research has shown that these gains come at a cost, however: increased risk for cardiovascular problems, stroke, and blood clots in the veins and lungs. Postmenopausal women on HRT also seem to be an increased risk for breast cancer and possibly dementia. This made many women feel they had to choose between improved quality of life and a risk of ill health and early death.\nNew study: Now research reported in the journal Circulation suggests a way around the blood clotting problem, at least. The researchers studied about 270 women who had developed blood clots in their veins, almost all of them postmenopausal. They were compared with more than 600 women who did not suffer from blood clots but similar in age, smoking status, and age at menopause. Among women in either group who used HRT, the study tracked whether the estrogen medication was taken orally or applied through the skin as a patch or a gel. The nature of the progestin component, if any, was also studied.\nFindings: Estrogen HRT increased the risk for blood clots in the veins\u2014but only if it was administered orally. This result is not as surprising as it might seem. A medication that\u2019s given orally collects in the blood supply of the intestines and passes through the liver before it is distributed to the rest of the body. This causes changes in the proteins synthesized by the liver, some of which are known to increase the clotting of blood. When the estrogen in HRT is administered through the skin, by contrast, it bypasses the liver. The study also established that some progestins (there are many kinds) increase the risk of blood clotting and that others do not.\nConclusion: If these findings are confirmed, HRT skin patches or gels and careful choice of the progestin component could normalize the risk of blood clots in the veins, and also blood clots that migrate to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, and to the brain, causing stroke. Unfortunately, other studies suggest that administering HRT through the skin won\u2019t affect the rate of heart disease or risk of breast cancer associated with it. HRT will still be a difficult choice. But this study at least lowers the risk and may well shift the balance for many women.\nSearch for a cause: It has long been clear that autism is primarily genetic in origin. The disorder is almost certainly the result not of a single abnormal gene, but rather the interaction of several. In the past, a few locations on human chromosomes have been suspected of playing a role for a scattering of patients. Now researchers have identified a genetic location on a specific chromosome that seems to be associated with the expression of autism in many patients.\nNewresearch: Described in a paper with 137 authors representing 67 worldwide institutions, this finding is the first result of an audacious project conducted by the Autism Genome Project Consortium. The project started with a set of almost 1,500 families with at least two people who fall on the autism spectrum. Of this group, DNA samples from about 1,200 families could be analyzed for chromosomal similarities.\nFindings: This analysis points to a hitherto unsuspected \u201chot spot\u201d on chromosome 11, which seems to be related to an increased risk for the expression of autism. (The genetic function of the hot-spot location is still unclear.) Besides identifying the chromosome 11 hot spot, the data also tantalizingly hint that flaws in the gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations\u2014the hot spot and the neruexin flaws\u2014", "baseline_completion": "fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn\u2019t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention.

The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you should tweak the environment in which they work to insure the best possible results.\nThere are many reasons why developing a protocol to measure efficiency benefits your business. You are able to pinpoint areas that need improvement, and you can break your team\u2019s performance down by tasks. Perhaps you will notice that the whole process is going smoothly except for one minor operation that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. This kind of insight can help you restructure the physical environment or delegate tasks in a new way to increase efficiency. You can also evaluate the performance of individual employees. Take a look at how much you get out of employees versus how much you pay them.\nEmployees might be a bit nervous about your new methods of close observation and evaluation. This is acceptable and sometimes even beneficial, as employees will make an increased effort if they know their performance is being tracked. However, you don't have to be an intimidating taskmaster. This is a good opportunity to mix in positive reinforcement and show your appreciation for your team. You can offer incentives, such as public recognition, time off or a share in productivity gains. Whatever mode you choose, employees are sure to improve efficiency if they feel that good work is rewarded and they develop a sense of the needs of the business as a whole.\nEmployees need to have the appropriate equipment and technology to carry out their functions efficiently.

The rink, which is a hundred and fifty feet by eighty feet, can accommodate up to two hundred people; at its center is a seventeen-foot-tall polar bear made of stainless steel, boxwood boughs, and lights. But what really makes the rink special is its surface: instead of ice, it's made of a special global-wanning-proof plas- tic. (Central Park \\XZ at 79th St. For more informa- tion, call 212-769-5200. Through Feb. 28.) AUCTIONS AND ANTIQUES With the two-week Impressionist -modern-postwar- contemporary smackdown over and done, the auc- tion houses settle back into their new everyday busi- ness-trying to sell expensive works of art in the midst of a bear market. This week, that means works by Latin-American masters. The painter Rufino Tamayo, who ably combined elements of Cubism and Surrealism with Mexican themes and a keen sense of color, is represented by six works in Sothe- by's Latin-American sales (Nov. 18-19). The most important is a monumental canvas from 1955, \"America,\" which for the past fifteen years has been on view at the Dallas Museum of Art. The Tamayos will share the podium with works by the Uruguayan- born modernist Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda and his fol- lowers (known as the School of the South) and by several female Surrealist painters, including Reme- dios Varo and Leonora Carrington. (York Ave. at 72nd St. 212-606-7000.) Christie's Latin-American sale (Nov. 19-20) also features a smattering of Tamayos, the most highly valued of which, \"Sere- nata a la Luna,\" depicts a solitary figure serenading the glowing night sky with a guitar. But the leading lot in this sale-which also includes works by Car- rington, Matta, and the Argentinean artist Emilio Pettoruti-is by Torres-Garc\u00eda, a stained-glass-like composition entitled \"Tres Figuras.\" A few days later, the house shows a more playful side in a pop- culture sale devoted to punk and rock-and-roll items and designer toys (Nov. 24); fans can bid on one of Bob Marley's guitars or on the portable organ played by John Lennon at Shea Stadium in 1965, as well as vintage posters and flyers for the Ramones and the Clash.

{"idx": 187, "truncated_input": "Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers.\nThis is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed\u2019s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed\u2019s death in 632AD, the only \u201ctraces we possess\u201d for the development of Islam \u201care either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages\u201d.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed\u2019s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the \u201cHoly Land\u201d, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, \u201ca version of Islam\u2019s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God\u201d, and in turn no room \u201cfor acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others\u201d, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland\u2019s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\nFocusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary", "baseline_completion": " boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style.

{"idx": 191, "truncated_input": "Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group, though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the company further reduces guidance. Although the fiscal quarter doesn&apos;t include the whole of holiday season, investors should expect to get a good read on whether Container Store had a successful time in a key season for the retail industry. If Container Store can&apos;t deliver an optimistic message this time around, its stock could easily end up headed downward once again.", "baseline_completion": "\nThe article Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

{"idx": 199, "truncated_input": "AMC Networks Earnings Beat Estimates, CEO Says 'Walking Dead' Franchise \"Will Have a Long Life\"\nAMC Networks on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid higher distribution and advertising revenue as management touted the outlook for hit show The Walking Dead, which is currently in its seventh season and which has been a big topic of debate among Wall Street analysts.\nAMC Networks shares were up 13.6 percent in early Thursday trading at $65.30 as investors cheered the upside earnings surprise.\nIn the company's earnings report, he had similarly said: \"The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\"\nAsked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: \"The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,\u201d rather than \u201conly a channel operator.\u201d He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels.\nAMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan.\nAsked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. \"We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters,\" said Sapan. \"And you don\u2019t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels.\" He added that his team felt that \"a day of reckoning would come\u201d for some peers.\nWhile the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, \"we have already skinnied our offering down.\u201d And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. \u201cCollectively, they are underpriced,\" said Sapan.\nThe cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility.\nAdjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was \"primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense.\" Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share. Estimates had come down a bit after Sapan in December said that advertising was looking softer than anticipated.\nA 9.2 percent increase in quarterly operating income and 9.2 percent adjusted operating income at the company's U.S. networks, which include AMC, IFC and SundanceTV, reflected higher revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses. \"The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses,\" the company said. \"Programming expenses included charges of $5 million in the current-year period related to the write-off of programming assets, as compared to charges of $16 million in the prior year period.\" The company didn't immediately say which show or shows the write-off was for.\nU.S. advertising revenue rose 3.1 percent despite lower ratings in the quarter for the first half of season seven of The Walking Dead. U.S. distribution revenue jumped 15.6 percent.\n\"2016 was a successful year for our company both financially and operationally, driven by our disciplined and focused strategy of investing in high-quality content and creating brands that have strong, growing, passionate and engaged audiences,\" said Sapan.\nHe continued: \"We are embracing changing viewing habits by making strategic investments in streaming services that fit well with our programming and the audiences at our network brands.

{"idx": 200, "truncated_input": "Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here\u2019s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don\u2019t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies\u2019 failures, Chopra said.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA\u2019s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be", "baseline_completion": " the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive\u2019s deadlines fast approaching, it\u2019s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency.

How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice. When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups.

{"idx": 212, "truncated_input": "On Tuesday, August 20, a US army veteran named Mark Paslawsky was killed during a battle in Ilovyask, near Donetsk, which is currently held by anti-Kiev rebels.\nFighting on the side of pro-government forces, the American had sprung to prominence because of his Twitter feed (@BruceSpringnote), often sharply critical of Ukrainian politicians, and a fawning video interview with Vice News\u2019 Simon Ostrovsky shortly before his death.\nThe 55-year-old West Point graduate, who was also a former investment banker, mainly focused on Moscow, Kharkov and Kiev, claimed he had changed his nationality to Ukrainian to enlist in the Donbass Battalion. Paslawsky fought under the pseudonym \u2018Franko\u2019 and served in the US army until at least 1991, when he was described as a captain in a New York Times op-ed.\nThere was a very good reason for Paslawsky\u2019s use of a nom-de-guerre like \u2018Franko\u2019 and the social media handle \u2018Bruce Springnote\u2019 and for the soft soap in the US media.\nPaslawsky was not an \u201cordinary Joe\u201d from New Jersey with benign family connections to Ukraine who suddenly decided to help defend the motherland, he was the nephew of the notorious Nazi Mykola Lebed \u2013 who incredibly was employed by the CIA from 1949 to possibly as late as 1991. There is no insinuation that Paslawksy also harbored fascist or anti-Semitic beliefs, but family influences surely played a significant role in the formation of his world view.\nLebed began his terrorist career in 1934 when he was sentenced to death for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki \u2013 later commuted to life imprisonment \u2013 but he escaped in 1939. He would go on to lead the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Poles in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (the area around Lutsk and Rivne in modern-day Ukraine).\nInstead of facing trial for his vicious war crimes after his fellow fascists in Germany were defeated, Lebed was spirited to America where \u2013 based in New York \u2013 he gathered information on the Soviet Union for the CIA (a scheme known as Operation Aerodynamic).\nOf course, sheltering Nazis was a common US practice after the war, as bizarre as it seems today, with the primary reason being their potential usefulness in the fight against the Soviet Union. The best known example is Klaus Barbie who they helped to escape to Bolivia, and later Argentina, but according to a 2009 National Archives report \u201cHitler\u2019s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, US Intelligence and the Cold War\u201d there were dozens of similar cases. Among them was Rudolf Mildner, who was \u201cresponsible for the execution of hundreds, if not thousands, of suspected Polish resisters\u201d and was also involved in the deportation of 8,000 Danish Jews to Auschwitz. The Americans helped Mildner to settle in Argentina. Another was Hans Scholl, a member of Einsatzgruppe B in Belarus, which was blamed for the execution of more than 45,000 people, most of them Jewish.\nThe report goes into great detail about the hideous crimes of Paslawsky\u2019s uncle. One man extensively quoted is Moshe Maltz, a Jew living in Sokal, a town about 85 kilometers north of Lviv: \u201cWhen the Bandera gangs (a name inspired by the chief Ukrainian Nazi leader, Stepan Bandera) seize a Jew, they consider it a prize catch. The ordinary Ukrainians feel the same way\u2026 they all want to participate in the heroic (sic) act of killing a Jew. They literally slash Jews to pieces with their machetes.\u201d Lebed trained at a Gestapo center in Zakopane.\nInterestingly, in 1985 the US Government Accountability Office in Washington mentioned Lebed\u2019s name in a public report on Nazis and collaborators who settled in the States with help from US intelligence agencies. The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in the Department of Justice began investigating Lebed that year.\nThe CIA shielded Lebed and, as late as 1991, it dissuaded the OSI from approaching the German, Polish, and Soviet governments for war-related records about Ukrainian fascists. Lebed, Bandera\u2019s wartime chief in Ukraine, died in 1998. He is buried in New Jersey.\nLeded married Sophia Hunczak, the sister of Taras Hunczak, a professor emeritus of Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he lectures in Ukrainian, Russian and European History. He also teaches at the Taras Shevchecnko University in Kiev. Despite being a child during World War II, his Ukrainian language Wikipedia entry, judging by the links and tone, an official bio, lists his service as a courier for Bandera\u2019s forces during the war.\nHunczak has written articles for Ukrainian journals whitewashing Roman Shukhevych and his Nachtigall Battalion, including some heavy duty eulogies obviously intended for internal consumption in the Ukrainian language. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles claims that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, the Nachtgall and their German comrades kidnapped and killed 4,000 Jews in Lviv. In 2007, the pro-NATO Ukrainian government of Viktor Yushchenko issued a postage stamp commemorating Shukhevych.\nSo how we do know Paslawsky is the nephew of Lebed after his extensive efforts to hide his true identity? His Ukrainian-language Wikipedia entry refers to him as being the nephew of Hunczak and also mentions a brother, Nestor.\nIn the September 13, 2009, edition of the US newspaper The Ukrainian Weekly, there is a death notice forSophia Lebed(this page has been removed from the PDF copy on their website as of August 28, but copies are in circulation, one pictured above) lists all her living relatives, including her brother, Taras Hunczak, and her nephews Nestor and Markian (Mark in English) Paslawsky. While it mentions Nestor\u2019s family, it doesn\u2019t for Mark \u2013 he told Ostrovsky in the Vice interview that he was a single man.\nA second death notice for Sophia, at the Union Funeral Home in New Jersey, describes her as the \u201cbeloved wife of the late Michael (the English form of Mykola) Lebed.\u201d Interestingly, this page was removed on August 27 after Ukrainian violinist Valentina Lisits", "baseline_completion": "a questioned the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty about it on Twitter \u2013 it now exists as a cached version only.\nSomebody has been trying to hide the true story of Mark Paslawskyin recent days and western media have shown no interest in telling it.\nThe German language has a word for coming to terms with the past: Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung.

{"idx": 217, "truncated_input": "Technological change has always posed a challenge for companies. But, as we saw once again in 2015, it has never occurred as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as today. As innovation sweeps across virtually every sector, from heavy industry to services, it is transforming the competitive landscape, with the most advanced companies\u2014rather than the largest or most established players\u2014coming out on top.\nFor incumbents, the threat of displacement is very real. The average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 has fallen from 90 years in 1935 to less than 18 years today. Disruptive new players like Uber, which has upended the taxi industry, are tough competitors, often staking out market share by shifting more surplus to consumers. This is part of a broader trend of intensifying competition that, according to recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute, could reduce the global after-tax profit pool from almost 10% of global GDP today to its 1980 level of about 7.9% within a decade.\nThe effect of technology on competition arises largely from the power of digital platforms and network effects. New digital platforms reduce marginal costs (the cost of producing additional units of a good or service) to nearly zero. Adding, say, a Google Maps user carries negligible costs, because the service relies on GPS location data that is already stored on a user\u2019s phone. This allows Google to scale incredibly quickly, and then to leverage this scale (and the convenience of having a single platform) to move into adjacent sectors\u2014such as music (Google Play), payment (Google Wallet), and word processing (Google Docs). In this manner, tech firms can quickly come to challenge incumbents in seemingly unrelated industries.\nOf course, tech firms are not the only ones innovating. A handful of leading firms in practically every industry are deploying digital technology in increasingly sophisticated ways\u2014and seeing huge benefits. The use of sensors to monitor livestock, for example, has far-reaching implications for the food industry.\nBut the most digitally advanced sectors show the greatest progress. Indeed, over the past 20 years, profit margins in these tech-infused sectors have grown two-three times faster, on average, than in the rest of the economy. Even within the most advanced sectors, there is a yawning gap between the top-performing companies and the rest of the pack. For example, the retail offerings of digitally advanced multinational banks far outstrip those of local credit unions.\nAs technology transforms business models and processes, it is also changing the way employees work. Recent McKinsey research finds that already-proven technologies could automate as much as 45% of the tasks individuals are currently paid to perform. In the US alone, that is the equivalent of about $2 trillion in annual wages.\nThe potential benefits of this transformation for companies extend far beyond cost savings, as workers gain time to pursue more valuable tasks involving critical thinking and creativity. Financial advisers can spend less time analysing financials and more time developing solutions that meet clients\u2019 needs. Or interior decorators can shift their attention from taking measurements to devising design concepts, meeting with clients, or sourcing materials.\nTechnology also allows companies to rethink conventional wisdom on organizational design and governance. New information-sharing technologies deliver greater transparency, making organizations more efficient and, in many cases, less hierarchical.\nFor example, the CEOs of Apple, Inditex (a multinational clothing company) and Zappos (a large online retailer) have adopted broad spans of control (the number of subordinates directly reporting to a manager) that far exceed the traditional model of \u201cone to four to eight\". Haier, the Chinese white-goods manufacturer, reorganized its 80,000-person workforce into 2,000 independent units, each responsible for managing its own profits and losses. Since the move, its market capitalization has soared, tripling from 2011 to 2014.\nMoreover, digitization allows companies to operate as \u201cplatforms\", not structures, and make greater use of resources outside their company. Insurance company Allstate used the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to invite programmers to develop a new car accident injury algorithm; the eventual \u201cwinner\" was 271% more accurate than its existing model.\nLikewise, China\u2019s DJI became the world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer by focusing on its products\u2019 core technology, while giving away developer kits for free online so that others could build apps. This approach meant that DJI\u2019s drones were equipped with attractive features far earlier than competitors\u2019 products, which relied on in-house app development.\nSimilar technology-driven innovations in thought processes and business models can be seen across the economy, reflected in changes in companies\u2019 planning processes. Some have begun creating separate business plans with two-month and 20-year views, reallocating their resources more aggressively, and using new analytical techniques to identify, attract", "baseline_completion": ", develop and retain talent.\nTechnological innovation enables\u2014indeed, requires\u2014companies to boost their agility and thus their competitiveness. That\u2019s why CEOs\u2019 top priorities in 2016 should be to digitize the core components of their business and rethink organizational design and governance processes.

In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million.

The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland reported their hottest mean temperatures on record. These included the coastal region of the state's north adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\nProfessor Hughes said some corals may regain their colour in the next three to six months, but it would take longer to see if they recovered their reproductive health and began a fuller recovery.\nThe faster growing branch corals and some other rapidly growing \"weedy\" species of corals could rebuild the reefs but the process would take years or even a decade.

{"idx": 229, "truncated_input": "Editor\u2019s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani\u2019s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can\u2019t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere\u2014either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today\u2019s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow\u2019s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that\u2019s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea\u2019s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn\u2019t inspire much hope.\nActually, it\u2019s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country\u2019s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as \u201cpassably capable\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d If by \u201cpassably capable\u201d they mean \u201cdoesn\u2019t torture too many people,\u201d then sure, I suppose they are \u201cpassably capable,\u201d but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That\u2019s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they\u2019re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that\u2019s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a \u201ccapable\u201d force doesn\u2019t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn\u2019t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is \u201cdropped from rolls\u201d (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he\u2019s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn\u2019t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nAn American solution to Afghanistan\u2019s problems faces the struggles of a dwindling security force to keep the Taliban at bay as they strike from sanctuaries in Pakistan, a government on the verge of collapse, and large numbers of civilians being victimized by their own government. And that\u2019s without the growing threat of the Islamic State. In an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019", "baseline_completion": "s the country the Americans promised them.\nThe reality is that that Afghanistan\u2019s future, while grim, is still better than it was.

{"idx": 231, "truncated_input": "WASHINGTON -- With television lights glaring, 20 lawmakers will gather next week to revisit the fight that consumed Congress before Christmas over renewing a Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.\nLittle real work will be done, but the meeting will mark the formal start of an effort to untangle a dispute that both parties want to resolve, though for different reasons. Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming", "baseline_completion": " GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law.", "orig_sample_length": 1244, "prompt_length": 1144, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": " Gov.

The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis. I am in favour of that.\"\nSo why should this bailout work when a previous one has failed, and in accepting the stringent conditions attached, has Greece surrendered control of its own economy?\nTo what extent will this second bailout rescue Greece's shattered economy, at what cost and how is this going to impact Greece's internal politics?\nJoining presenter Mike Hanna on Inside Story are guests: Fokion Zaimis, a small business owner and the CEO of Science Park; Vicky Pryce, a Greek-born economist and the former joint head of the UK government economic service; and Constantine Michalos, an economist and president of the", "baseline_completion": " Athens chamber of commerce and industry.\n\"There is already an EU task force here and they are trying to make sure that the various ministries that are important to the economy do the right thing.

Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy became Rita Repulsa\u2019s evil Green Ranger, she made a play for Zack, the Black Ranger. After being \u201cupstaged\u201d by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn\u2019t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack\u2019s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It\u2019s perfect for this series. I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He\u2019s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we\u2019ve seen in this series isn\u2019t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he\u2019s not afraid to show it. That\u2019s not the character we\u2019ve seen in this series. For the most part he\u2019s been very straight faced. I understand he\u2019s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren\u2019t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita\u2019s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the \u201cGreen Candle\u201d episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, \u201cI need to do more \u2026 I don\u2019t care about leading. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita\u2019s plan for Zack doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he\u2019s selfless. It\u2019s more about the good that\u2019s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita\u2019s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn\u2019t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya\u2019s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister. Again, his Zack seems very reserved and stoic, which is not the character we\u2019re used to.\n\u201cThe Ongoing Adventures of Bulk & Skull\u201d still doesn\u2019t do much for me. Though we do get a surprise in this issue: The BOOM! Studios debut of Lieutenant Stone, Bulk & Skull\u2019s foil from seasons 3 and 4. I\u2019d always been under the impression they\u2019d never met before. Either way, I\u2019m glad to see the putty patroller story is over. On to (hopefully) better things.\nHiggins pleasantly surprised me with this Zack story, by following up on a plot seed he\u2019d planted as far back as issue #1. It makes you wonder what else he might come back to in future issues. Whether it\u2019s how Billy sees his role on the team, Jason feeling threatened by Tommy, or something else fans may have wondered about. There\u2019s so much fertile ground to cover, and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\nThis entry was posted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels and tagged Billy Cranston, Black Ranger, BOOM!

Speeches and footage from several al Qaeda leaders from around the world were shown interlaced with combat footage from the African jihadist group.\nAt the very beginning of the video, JNIM showed its media division, Az Zallaqa, as being in the same family as other al Qaeda media wings. This includes As Sahab (al Qaeda central\u2019s media division), Al Malahem (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), Al Kata\u2019ib (Shabaab), and al Andalus (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). By putting its media wing alongside other media branches of the global jihadist organization, JNIM is portraying Az Zallaqa as another official al Qaeda media organization.\nThis is important as some have categorized JNIM as merely being \u201clinked\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d with al Qaeda. However, JNIM clearly sees itself on equal footing with al Qaeda\u2019s official branches around the world.\nAs the video progresses, JNIM depicts its conflict in Mali as being the same conflict seen in various places around the world, such as Nigeria, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Various killed al Qaeda leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, Nasir al Wuyashi, Anwar al Awlaki, Ibn Khattab, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, Abu al Hasan al Rashid al Bulaydi, Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Abu Firas al Suri, and Muhammad al Zahawi, are shown in a eulogy segment.\nA speech from Sulayman Abu al Ghaith, a former al Qaeda spokesman who is now serving a life sentence in the US, can be heard over footage of combat from JNIM. \u201cGod ordered us to protect the vulnerable, so we protect the vulnerable. God ordered us to terrorize the apostates, so we terrorize the apostates. God ordered us to kill the leaders of disbelief, so we kill the leaders of disbelief,\u201d al Ghaith said as he linked al Qaeda\u2019s jihad to \u201cprotecting the vulnerable\u201d around the world.\nThe message then shifted to lambasting both Mali and France for their efforts to combat the jihadist group in the West African country. JNIM used English-speaking political commentators to suggest France\u2019s involvement in Mali is a large conspiracy as part of a wider war against Islam. A JNIM official identified as Abdul Hakim al Muhajir [implying he is a foreign fighter] reiterated in this point in a long-winded tirade against France.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s war on Muslims in the region is not a economic war \u2026 it is between faith and apostasy, and Islam and idolatry,\u201d al Muhajir stated in his speech. That theme was common for JNIM and its predecessor groups in Mali, as it painted France as an occupying force oppressing Muslims in a war against Islam. Speeches and statements from various JNIM leaders, including Iyad Ag Ghaly and Yahya Abu al Hammam \u2013 its emir and deputy emir respectively \u2013 have focused on this exact trope in the last three years.\nYahya Abu al Hammam continued that trend by also making a short speech against France and the G5 Sahel forces operating in Mali. This was immediately before showing suicide bombers and an assault team training for the April 14 suicide assault on the joint UN-French base in Timbuktu.

Priebus remained largely loyal to Trump during his unorthodox campaign, although he sometimes struggled to defend the nominee\u2019s many statements about treatment of women and minorities.\nA Globe analysis of the state\u2019s election results showed a reddening of the state\u2019s western counties.\nPriebus, supporters suggest, is a Republican Party loyalist who will bring D.C. experience and political acumen to a White House lacking both. He was chosen over a much more controversial, and less-well known, candidate: Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News and the chief strategist of the Trump campaign. Bannon has a history of using his prominence to support anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racist messages, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog group.\nIn the Trump administration, Bannon will serve as a chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.\n\u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,\u201d Trump said in the announcement.\nThe developments come at an extraordinarily divisive period in American politics.\nPresident-elect Trump with Reince Priebus on election night. Priebus will serve as chief of staff in Trump\u2019s White House.\nIn urban centers, protesters are speaking out against the presidential election, decrying the bombastic \u2014 and sometimes offensive \u2014 rhetoric that Trump used during the election season. Republicans, though giddy at the prospect of a conservative White House, Congress, and Supreme Court, are also unclear on just how much of Trump\u2019s lofty campaign promises he will attempt to fulfill.\nIndeed, in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump signaled that part of his promised wall at the Mexico border \u2014 a signature pledge during his campaign \u2014 might actually be a fence.\nElsewhere on Sunday, Republican leaders also seemed to back away from some of Trump\u2019s policy promises, including jailing Clinton, building the border wall, and implementing a deportation force.\nSpeaking on Fox News, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he does not expect Congress to push any further investigations of Clinton, despite the often-repeated rallying cry of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at Trump\u2019s rallies. McCarthy also expressed skepticism at the idea of mass deportations.\n\u2018\u2018First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we\u2019ll have discussions,\u201d McCarthy said.\nRyan, the House speaker who has rallied behind Trump after months of carefully putting distance between himself and the nominee, was more direct than McCarthy.\n\u201cI think we should put people\u2019s minds at ease. That is not what our focus is,\u201d said Ryan, of Wisconsin.\nRyan\u2019s words and the seemingly moderated tone of the president-elect might not calm the fears of Democrats, protesters nationwide, and historically marginalized communities, many of which felt demonized throughout the Trump campaign.\nSome left-leaning activists have reacted to Trump\u2019s election by rushing to social media to claim Trump is #NotMyPresident, despite the looming truth of Inauguration Day. Others, such as US Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted the election results but pledged to hold Trump accountable for the divisive rhetoric he at times deployed.\nThis sentiment, coupled with a recent flare of incidents in which self-described Trump voters were harassing people of different cultures, has received a mixed reaction from Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 and the president-elect himself.\nTrump has made clear that he intends to use Twitter to get his message out, and he continued to snipe at the media over the weekend.\nStephen Bannon, whom Donald Trump named his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, at Trump Tower Saturday.\n\u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet posted at 3 a.m. Sunday.\nIn the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump explained that he uses Twitter to \u201cget the word out\u2019\u2019 and go around traditional media outlets.\n\u201cWhen you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI have a method of fighting back.\u201d He vowed to be \u201cvery restrained\u201d in his Twitter posts.\nOn the Sunday morning political talk shows, Trump\u2019s surrogates and advisers downplayed the nationwide anger that continued to surface since his surprising win. Instead, each attempted to recast Trump as a political unifier, a humbled leader capable of compromise and willing to govern for all Americans.\nThere is one area in which Democrats and Republicans agree: the need for Trump to sign a robust law investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, mentioned public works projects on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, and on CBS News, Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted infrastructure as one area of possible common ground.\n\u201cLet\u2019s", "baseline_completion": " see the details.

{"idx": 255, "truncated_input": "What are neutrophils and what do they do?\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve infections. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55\u201370 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood cells appear in significant levels in the blood, the doctor will request a bone marrow sample.\nBone marrow collection involves inserting a long needle into part of the pelvis near the back of your hip. The procedure can be very painful, and a doctor will typically take the sample in a hospital setting with at least a local anesthetic.\nExperts will examine the bone marrow sample to see if neutrophils and other blood cells are developing correctly and are in regular supply.\nLeukopenia is a condition where a person has a reduced white blood cell levels in their bloodstream. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and treatments here.\nChanges in neutrophil levels are often a sign of more significant changes in white blood cell levels.\nIn non-pregnant adults, a white blood cell blood count over 11,000 per mm3 is known as leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs when a person has over 7,000 per mm3 mature neutrophils in their bloodstream.\nMinor changes in neutrophil or white blood cell levels are typically nothing to worry about as long as they are temporary. A raised white blood cell count often means the body is responding to infection, injury, or stress.\nSome people have naturally lower levels of white blood cells and neutrophils than other people due to a range of factors, including congenital conditions.\nIf neutrophil or white blood cell levels are significantly altered for no apparent reason or remain raised or lowered, a doctor will order more tests to determine the cause.\nSeverely high or low levels of white blood cells often require emergency care and monitoring. People with severe neutropenia will have an inadequate defense against infection.\nPeople with severe neutrophilia typically have a life-threatening type of infection or other inflammatory illness that requires treatment, such as cancer.\nNutritional yeast is a plant-based source of vitamin B-12.\nThe best way to correct abnormal neutrophil levels is to address and treat the underlying cause.\nAntibiotics can treat bacterial infections, while antifungal medicine treats fungal infections. People can treat certain viral infections with medications that slow viral activity. Otherwise, supportive therapies, such as fluids and rest, may be part of the treatment plan.\nPeople with altered neutrophil levels caused by medications or procedures may need to stop or adjust treatments.\nPeople with severely low levels of neutrophils often require monitoring, antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization to reduce the risk of severe infection.\nThis period of intensive care helps keep people with weakened immune systems away from potentially harmful microorganisms. It also supports the body, giving it time to produce more white blood cells.\nTry not to over-exercise or exercise beyond comfort levels.\nReduce stress levels and treat chronic or severe stress.\nSeek medical attention for signs of infection, such as fever, weakness, fatigue, or pain, and treat infections exactly as prescribed.\nFollow a healthful, balanced diet.\nTreat chronic conditions, such as genetic or inflammatory conditions, exactly as prescribed.\nHowever, people with only minor or mild changes in their neutrophil blood levels often show no symptoms and do not require any treatment.\nHaving a healthy number of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow is crucial to the correct working of the immune system.\nWhen neutrophil levels are higher or lower than usual for more than a short period, a doctor will order several tests to work out the underlying cause.

{"idx": 261, "truncated_input": "Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.\nWhen a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades.\nBut a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.\nPress this big button to record.\nEnter Music Memos, a new iOS app from Apple. This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations,\" a term used to describe computer-based recording programs) such as ProTools and Logic extensively over the years, I've always found the GarageBand approach hard to wrap my head around. But, this new 2.1 update adds some interesting new features that make it easier than ever to get started crafting or arranging music, even if you have little or no experience.\nThe Live Loops interface in GarageBand.\nThe most notable is an entirely new (and entirely optional) interface called Live Loops. It's a performance-friendly sequencer for arranging samples and loops, which can be lined up to play in order, or simply triggered on the fly by tapping on the appropriate square-shaped loop. Apple includes several preloaded templates in different music genres, or you can start with a blank field and import various loops and samples, or original recordings made in GarageBand. With the right tempo and note information (routinely included with commercial samples and loops) the Live Loops interface keeps all the parts in sync and flowing together naturally.\nThe idea reminds me of performance-friendly music programs such as Ableton Live, but this version is much more pick-up-and-play, and my four-year-old was having a great time with it, triggering samples and creating on-the-fly arrangements in under a minute. Live Loops is fun to play with, but probably more useful for live improvisation from the DJ booth or creating EDM arrangements than traditional songwriting and recording.\nOutside of Live Loops, there's also the standard music recording and editing tools in GarageBand, augmented by some new automation features and EQ tools for tweaking the overall sound.\nYou can still record audio via an external mic or your device's built-in mic (although the latter is not really recommended) or play virtual guitars and keyboards on-screen, which is fun but involves a lot of trial and error to get a feel for. \"Smart\" versions of these instruments will play preset patterns based on chord information you provide. That can give you an instant backing band for ideas, but again, there's a robotic sameness to the performances and the styles are on the dry side, so it's not going to replace calling your musically talented friends up and asking them to play on your album.\nNew for GarageBand 2.1 is the addition of Drummer, a high-concept AI drum tool previously found only in the $200 Logic Pro software. Drummer starts with several fictional drummer profiles, each with his or her own music genres and drum kits, and builds a drum track for your song that can be adjusted on the fly to be louder, softer, more or less complex, using different cymbal or kick/snare variations, and with more or fewer fills. The end result is pretty good, and much more human-feeling than basic drum loops or samples. Although, again, the genre choices tend to run towards EDM, straightforward rock, and commercial-sounding hip-hop", "baseline_completion": "/R&B.

{"idx": 269, "truncated_input": "DENMARK - UK \u2013 ASIA - EUROPE \u2013 In a bold move designed to out manoeuvre their rivals Maersk, the largest container shipping line in the world, today announced what they consider to be the first major step forward in box transportation for well over a decade. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 will offer guaranteed delivery times from four Asian ports to three major European hubs for any FCL freight deliveries every day of the week.\nSpeaking at the London launch Eivind Kolding, CEO Maersk Line said that from the company's inception in 1928 very little changed from the monthly schedules offered until in the late 1940\u2019s when twice monthly services appeared. Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990\u2019s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk\u2019s intention to offer shippers a \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier\u2019s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU\u2019s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n\u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company\u2019s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line\u2019s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed to conserve expensive fuel and reduce pollution levels, simply to stick to schedules.\n\u201cThis is the first time compensation will be paid by a shipping company and this is to underscore our confidence in this product. We have been in discussion with a number of customers, including Sony, and they have expressed approval. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 responds to some key concerns by ensuring on time delivery in Northern Europe. How can we do this? By upping capacity and spreading port calls and having a back up plan for every vessel. All the customer needs is total transport. We see larger customers with sophisticated management systems taking advantage of this and reducing their warehousing needs.\nNo partnerships with other lines will be involved in the provision of this service and, before anyone believes this will be rolled out globally, even Maersk admit that the daily cut off system is currently only feasible on the busy Asia to Europe run. Cynics will note that Maersk are due to collect a lot more of the bigger container vessels they have on order within the next year or two and they need cargo to fill them but there is no doubt that other box carriers will feel a chill down their spines at what is a very inventive and bold move to completely dominate the Asian European freight trade.\nThe first daily cut off will be on the 24th October, the guaranteed transportation times to the three European ports (Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam) are as follows. Ex Ningbo \u2013 36 days, ex Shanghai \u2013 34 days, ex Yantian \u2013 30 days and for Tanjung Pelepas \u2013 26 days. Transportation time is defined as from the cut off date issued for the departure port and the availability of the cargo at the port of destination. If cargo arrives early there will be no demurrage charges until the agreed cargo availability date has passed.\nAround seven million forty foot equivalent units pass from Asia to Northern Europe annually and Maersk currently shift over one million of them.

Public Domain/U.S. Govt. photo.\nOn this day in 1948, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and widow of the heir to the Devonshire dukedom, died in a plane crash en route to secure her father's blessings on her second marriage. She was born on February 20, 1920, and was only 28 at the time of her death.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed JFK's father Joseph Kennedy ambassador to the Court of St. James, his daughter Kathleen spent a year and a half living in London. She was educated in London at Queen's College.\nBeautiful and spirited, she was named the \"most exciting debutante of 1938.\" In 1943 she returned to England to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross.\nDespite the opposition of her intensely Catholic mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy, known to friends as \"Kick\", married William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, a Protestant and the eldest son and heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire on May 6, 1944.\nOther than her eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. who died in a plane crash three months after the wedding, no one from the Kennedy family attended the marriage ceremony. Her husband was killed in action only four months later in World War II, and his younger brother Andrew Cavendish, married to Deborah Mitford, became the heir to the dukedom. See the newspaper report of her death on right.\nPopular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits - though more traditional members of British society found fault with her boisterousness - the dashing young widow eventually became the mistress of Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam. The couple planned to wed after Fitzwilliam's planned divorce. Instead, while on a trip to visit Joseph Kennedy Sr. and gain his blessing for their relationship, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lady Hartington died in an airplane crash in Saint-Bauzile, Ard\u00e8che, France.\nOnly her father represented the Kennedy family at her funeral. Her mother, Rose, declined to attend supposedly because of Kathleen's intention to marry outside the Catholic Church a second time.\nIt is also said that Rose Kennedy also discouraged Kathleen's siblings from attending for the same reason. Rose apparently forgave Kathleen not long thereafter, and in 1951, she was reportedly delighted that her first grandchild, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy, was named after her late daughter. However, the family requested that the child not be nicknamed Kick.\nThe Marchioness of Hartington is buried in the Cavendish family plot at Saint Peter's Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. Among the wreaths that covered her coffin was one with a handwritten note from Sir Winston Churchill. The gymnasium at Manhattanville College is named in her honor.\nOn this day in 2005 the U.S. Department of Defense changed its mind about base closings, and that was the end of Otis NG as an air base.\nThe largest New England facilities saved by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) were the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Maine, and the Naval Submarine", "baseline_completion": " Base New London, in Connecticut -- each with thousands of jobs.

South Mountain Drive.\nGov. Doug Ducey was quick to criticize the decision, calling the announcement, \"concerning\" because state agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at the facility to ensure patient safety.\n\"For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. \"Forcing this medically fragile community to move should be a last resort. Everyone's first priority should be protecting their health and safety.\"\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Economic Security were similarly upset by the announcement, calling it \"very disturbing news\" and imploring Hacienda HealthCare to work with the state moving forward.\n\"We want to find a path forward that is in the best interests of the patients \u2014 and this approach is not it,\" an emailed statement from spokeswoman Tasya Peterson says.\n\"State agencies are exhausting all efforts to bring this to a conclusion that is beneficial to the patients, some of whom have been at this facility nearly their entire lives,\" she said. \"They are the ones who should come first, without question.

Though the board's vote was acknowledged, Hacienda did not provide a notice to terminate, nor did it provide a transition plan, Ptak said.\n\"In fact, through today discussions continued around developing an ongoing plan to ensure the care of patients at the facility,\" he wrote in a message Thursday evening.\nHacienda HealthCare officials on Thursday said they will begin to transition clients and eventually will cease to operate the facility.\nIn its most recent federal survey, Hacienda's intermediate care facility had 39 patients ranging in age from 16 to 68.

I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is : Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't.

While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere's no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar. Researchers are finding that paleo diets may offer potential benefits.

Another pharmacy employee, who gave her name only as Norma, said the increased federal security that arrived this week appeared to have done little to discourage the Knights Templar cartel, which has subjected local residents to systematic extortion for years.\nBut federal forces have other challenges, as well. The local police in Apatzingan were considered so untrustworthy that the entire 300-man force was relieved of duty and sent out of town for background checks.\nOfficials from the federal and Michoacan state governments met until late Tuesday with leaders of \u201cself-defense\u201d groups.\nWhile refusing to give up their weapons, vigilante leaders appeared to be seeking a cooling of tensions.\n\u201cWe have to be discreet with our weapons and not move up and down the highways with them,\u201d said Hipolito Mora, a lime grower who leads the self-defense group in the town of La Ruana, after the meeting.\nInterior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed the talks had taken place, and said the government was offering jobs as police to qualified members of the self-defense forces.\nThe spokesman for the vigilante movement, Estanislao Beltran, previously said the vigilantes weren\u2019t interested in such offers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want jobs as policemen. We\u2019re fighting for the freedom of our families,\u201d he said.\nThe talks came after soldiers clashed with townspeople in Antunez, where at least two men were reportedly killed during the confrontation that began late Monday. Video of the clash aired by Milenio Television showed a chaotic scene in which angry townspeople scuffled with soldiers and apparently tried to grab the gun and equipment of at least one soldier.\nThe unrest is in a region of Michoacan known as Tierra Caliente, a farming area rich in limes, avocados and mangos where vigilante groups have been trying to drive out the Knights Templar drug cartel. After a weekend of firefights, the government announced Monday that it would take on security duties in the area.\nThroughout Tuesday, federal police officers and soldiers set up roadside checkpoints just yards from roadblocks manned by vigilantes on routes into towns controlled by self-defense groups, but there were no attempts to take weapons from the civilians.\nOne federal officer who was not authorized to speak to the press said they had no orders to disarm anyone, or to try to take towns held by vigilantes, who have surrounded Apatzingan, which is said to be a Knights Templar stronghold.\nHundreds of federal police officers poured into Apatzingan, the region\u2019s main city, in pickup trucks mounted with machines guns, armored vehicles and buses. They massed in the city\u2019s main square.\nCritics have suggested that some self-defense groups have been infiltrated by the rival New Generation cartel, which the vigilantes vehemently deny.\nAfter initially arresting vigilantes months ago, the federal government has appeared to be working with them recently.

{"idx": 294, "truncated_input": "LAURA'S is just what Oyster Bay needs and its residents know it. They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are crowds waiting in the bar.\nPart of the draw is James Paskins, the restaurant's chef and owner, who acquired a following during his years at the Coach Grill, also in Oyster Bay. His wife and other family members efficiently handle the front of the house. Another crowd pleaser is the reasonable prices. Entrees start at $11 and top out at $18.\nLaura's, named for Mr. Paskins's late mother, looks much as it did last year, when 68 West Main was at this location. It is spacious and comfortable. The dining room is defined by white columns, carved molding, smoky mirrors and crystal chandeliers. In a town filled with casual cafes, Laura's smart good looks make it stand out.\nOne new feature is the entrance through the bar. This, no doubt, eliminates drafts in the dining room but the crowded, smoky bar does not make a positive first impression. The dining room, however, is a place of charm and serenity.\nOther salad sensations are a just-right Caesar and a plate of grilled vegetables served atop baby greens with a balsamic vinaigrette as a dipping sauce. The seafood salad carries a price tag ($12) that is higher than some entrees, but this abundant assembly could be a main course. It stars jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, calamari, scungilli, chopped peppers, red onions, celery and black olives in a lemon-basil vinaigrette.\nOther openers I would order again are tender clams oreganata with a refreshingly spare use of bread crumbs, New Zealand mussels in a sherry pink sauce enlivened by spicy, smoky andouille sausage, a huge crab cake made lighter by the inclusion of shredded vegetables and two big portobellos served on a bed of grilled tomatoes and baby spinach. One creation that does not work, though, is the smoked-salmon-crusted-oysters. The delicate bivalves never had a chance. The assertive bready topping was too much for them. Every day a different homemade ravioli ($13) is featured. On my visit, they were filled with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives and tossed with big chunks of succulent chicken, chopped tomatoes, broccoli and an abundance of garlic. A winner! Another tasty pasta pick was fettuccine hidden under a mountain of sliced shell steak, three types of mushrooms and a chunky tomato sauce.\nFish were all cooked with precision. The herb-crusted tuna was rare as ordered and a special of striped bass in a tomato-basil sauce was moist and flaky as was sauteed tilapia in a mushroom-lemon-wine sauce.\nGood meat selections include chicken medallions in a brown sauce spiked with bourbon and touched with cream, a juicy grilled rib eye, a tasty shell steak marinated in teriyaki sauce and a memorable rack of lamb special, served pink as ordered, atop a bed of barely wilted baby spinach.

{"idx": 296, "truncated_input": "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night\u2019s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d an intense episode of Lost\u2013and I\u2019m sure we will\u2013but let\u2019s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI\u2019ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force\u2013call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want\u2013who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where\u2013whatever they have done in the past\u2013they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I\u2019m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters\u2019 redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it \u201cgood\u201d to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It\u2019s better, maybe, but I\u2019m not sure Jacob\u2019s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could \u201cprove [Smokey] wrong?\u201d Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons\u2013the \u201cscience-based\u201d story, if you will\u2013aren\u2019t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want\u2013and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d again proved Lost\u2019s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2014or, specifically, as O\u2019Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver\u2019s phrasing and manner made clear he and O\u2019Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to\u2026?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we\u2019ve seen him in the Island\u2019s present?

But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO\u2019s Carniv\u00e0le, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo\u2019s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I\u2019m not going to: is this the first time we\u2019ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock\u2019s hold\u2013I assume it\u2019s significant, and I have no explanation for it. (My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella?

{"idx": 298, "truncated_input": "So now Stephen Harper needs the Indians.\nIt seems everybody does these days \u2014 for all the wrong reasons.\nAccording to sources who have seen Harper consultant Doug Eyford\u2019s confidential report, Stephen Harper\u2019s bureaucrats have not done him any favours in moving the Northern Gateway file forward. Eyford told the PM that genuine engagement with First Nations is the only path left. For a variety of reasons, selling the pipeline to First Nations leaders is now an unofficial panic situation.\nAs things now stand, the odds are against a deal with West Coast bands on the pipeline that is supposed to carry Alberta bitumen through British Columbia and out to Asian markets.\nFrom industry and government\u2019s perspective, time is of the essence. They want a delivery system for Alberta raw oil before other countries with energy for sale put a long-term lock on the markets that are up for grabs, particularly China.\nBy contrast, First Nations leaders will not be hustled into a quick or unsatisfactory deal. Northern Gateway is a multiple sore spot for them. They feel as though they have been ignored, marginalized and, to a degree, vilified. There was even a pitiful attempt to buy them off \u2014 with a 10-per-cent equity position in Northern Gateway. If it were only a matter of numbers, a deal-winning arrangement would be a stake at least three times as large.\nBut it\u2019s not just dollars. It is a matter of reasonable fears by First Nations leaders about protection of the land and water in the wake of the Harper government\u2019s gutting of environmental regulations in its anti-democratic and notorious omnibus legislation.\nIt is also a matter of trust: The Harper government doesn\u2019t enjoy much of that in the native community these days. Normally, that wouldn\u2019t bother a government that deals with opposition by taking out a baseball bat and going head-hunting.\nBut this time bullying and bulldozing can\u2019t bring the First Nations into line. They have the Constitution and scores of court decisions in their favour. This time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance.\nThe truth is, they might not bother.\nThis time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance. The truth is, they might not bother.\nStephen Harper\u2019s trust account is badly overdrawn. Native leaders will not soon forget how the Conservatives blithely walked away from the work-in-progress that was the Kelowna Accord.\nAlthough former prime minister Paul Martin wasn\u2019t around long enough to implement a program that aimed at ending native poverty in a decade, his plan enjoyed wide support and created something even more seductive: a sense of optimism.\nThen-Opposition leader Stephen Harper claimed that he supported the plan to end native poverty and the principles of the Kelowna Accord, though he differed on how that should be accomplished.\nPut that in the same category with Harper\u2019s promises not to mess with income trusts or the Old Age Supplement. Canada\u2019s First Nations leaders have had their bags packed for that meeting for going on seven years but the invitation, apparently, is still in the mail.\nThat statement covers more than one million people.\nBut when Federal Court Judge Michael Phelan ruled in 2013 that Metis and non-status Indians were in fact \u201cIndians\u201d under section of 91/24 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister did not adopt the advice he once gave with such alacrity to the provinces and the territories to discharge their responsibilities. He decided instead to appeal the decision and dispute the ruling that said 600,000 \u201cnew\u201d aboriginals came under federal jurisdiction.\nIt\u2019s the same story on reserves after seven years of Stephen Harper \u2014 the water is still poor, the housing Third World and the health outcomes a national scandal. The best Harper could manage during the Idle No More protests aimed at holding Ottawa to its responsibilities was to mock Chief Theresa Spence.\nThe last blow to the PM\u2019s credibility on the aboriginal street may well be the government\u2019s vaunted native education legislation \u2014 a plan AFN Chief Shawn Atleo has already panned because it was conceived, as most of this government\u2019s legislation is, unilaterally.\nIt is not, in the end, that Stephen Harper has done nothing for Canada\u2019s First Nations. There has been good work on human rights, for example, and real progress on the thorny issue of matrimonial reserve property.\nThere has also been some progress on First Nation\u2019s governance. But there has been no consistent record of striking the new relationship once promised, and which looked so promising in the lustre surrounding the government\u2019s apology to Canada\u2019s aboriginals for the cultural atrocities of the residential schools.\nThere are things the federal government could do to help win First Nations\u2019 support for pipeline plans. One is to make the bands in B.C. true stakeholders by recognizing the order of wealth transfer that must take place.\nBrian Crowley and Ken Coates of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute came up with some excellent ideas: developing an advanced, evidence-based pipeline and shipping system with input from First Nations and environmental groups; designating the corridor land for pipelines as reserves under the Indian Act, thereby creating another revenue stream for First Nations which could collect taxes; and creating an endowment to cover the cost of oil spills and their clean-up \u2014 though no one believes after Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon that any fund could ever hold enough money.\nEven under those circumstances, Northern Gateway is still a very tough sell, and not just to First Nations leaders.

Vastly outnumbered by halfwits and fellow travellers, I reached for the most conciliatory point available. \u201cChavez was no democrat,\" I muttered, after viewing clips of various silly pundits denouncing him as a dictator, \"but words mean things.\" An authoritarian, yes, but he didn't quite rise to the definitional standard of dictator. \u201cYou can go to Venezuela, you can be in the opposition, you can read [opposition newspaper] El Nacional...\u201d And on and on I droned.\nIt was a tedious point, and one that, in pursuit of a narrow semantic argument, elided all the undemocratic developments in Venezuela since Chavez began his campaign of political and social polarization, his destruction of the country\u2019s economy and already tattered democratic institutions. But compared to my fellow guests, I was something of a counterrevolutionary, a wrecker, an ideological deviationist serving the interests of the bourgeoise. Or the CIA. Or USAID. A particularly radical panelist, one of those sad little political pilgrims always sniffing out the next Third World utopia, had argued in the days after Chavez's death that \"the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that Ch\u00e1vez was authoritarian but that he wasn\u2019t authoritarian enough.\"\nMy academic co-panelist, so disappointed in Chavez\u2019s apparently mild form of Castroism, can rejoice in the disastrous but sufficiently authoritarian rule of his chosen successor, the former bus driver and Chavez confidante Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the Cuban-trained Maduro, who has variously claimed to have seen Chavez\u2019s ghost in bird form and reported that his mentor\u2019s apparition was spotted loitering in the Caracas subway system, rendered the autocrat-versus-dictator debate moot this week when he ordered the arrest of the handsome, telegenic, and Harvard-trained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. It was Lopez and his allies who helped organize a series of protest marches in the past week, during which three people were brutally gunned down--and the weight of evidence, much of it marshalled by the usually pro-government newspaper \u00daltimas Noticias, suggests that all three were killed by Maduro\u2019s goon squads.\nSo naturally, the government ordered the arrest of...Lopez.\nAnd yesterday, at the start of a large\u2014and illegal\u2014opposition march (the government had a counter demonstration, which oddly wasn\u2019t declared illegal), Lopez gave a short speech and turned himself over to the National Guard. It was an astoundingly brave bit of defiance; after all, is there a place on Earth worse than the inside of a Venezuelan prison? And a lesser man, like myself, would have sprinted to the airport and hopped the next flight to Miami. But there was Lopez, after having tenderly kissed and bid farewell to his wife, being wrenched into a waiting police van, a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a clutch of white flowers in the other.

Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one\u2019s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in \u201clive and let live\u201d, \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god\u2019s name acts as an icing on the cake.\nLife is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy.

He was 62 and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire, England.\nThe cause was complications of cancer and intestinal surgery, his family said in a statement.\nMr. Gibb had been hospitalized for intestinal problems several times in the last two years. Cancer had spread from his colon to his liver, and in the weeks before his death he had pneumonia and for a while was in a coma.\nMr. Gibb was the second Bee Gee and third Gibb brother to die. His fraternal twin and fellow Bee Gee, Maurice Gibb, died of complications of a twisted intestine in 2003 at 53. The youngest brother, Andy, who had a successful solo career, was 30 when he died of heart failure, in 1988.\nWith brilliant smiles, polished funk and adenoidal close harmonies, the Bee Gees \u2014 Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb \u2014 were disco\u2019s ambassadors to Middle America in the 1970s, embodying the peacocked look of the time in their open-chested leisure suits and gold medallions.\nThey sold well over 100 million albums and had six consecutive No. 1 singles from 1977 to 1979. They were also inextricably tied to the disco era\u2019s defining movie, \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d a showcase for their music that included the hit \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d its propulsive beat in step with the strut of the film\u2019s star, John Travolta.\nBarry, the oldest brother, was the dominant Bee Gee for most of the group\u2019s existence. But the lead singer for many of the early hits was Robin, whose breaking voice, gaunt frame and gloomy eyes were well suited to convey adolescent fragility. \u201cI Started a Joke\u201d (with the second line, \u201cWhich started the whole world crying\u201d), \u201cI\u2019ve Gotta Get a Message to You,\u201d \u201cMassachusetts\u201d and other heavy-hearted songs brought the Bee Gees to the top of the charts as one of the British Invasion\u2019s most musically conservative groups.\nRobin Hugh Gibb and his twin, Maurice, were born on Dec. 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. (Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in Manchester, England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.\nAccording to Bee Gees lore, the boys\u2019 first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.\nThe family moved to Australia in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees \u2014 for Brothers Gibb \u2014 began scoring local hits and appearing on television. They left for London in early 1967 and within weeks had signed with Robert Stigwood, the impresario who guided them in their peak years.\nThe band\u2019s first single in Britain, \u201cNew York Mining Disaster 1941,\u201d was released in April 1967 and reached the Top 20.\nBut in private Robin was far from dull. He and his wife, Dwina Murphy, who survives him, lived in a 12th-century former monastery in Oxfordshire that he had restored and filled with statues of Buddha and suits of armor. In Miami, his mansion was open to celebrities and politicians like Tony Blair.\nRobin briefly left the group in 1969 and tried out a solo career. After he rejoined his brothers, they scored their first No. 1 in the United States with \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d in 1971. But with harder rock taking over, the Bee Gees\u2019 popularity ebbed, reaching bottom in 1974 with a series of supper-club gigs in England to pay off tax debts.\nAt that point their label, Atlantic, sent the brothers to Miami for musical experimentation. There, with the 1975 album \u201cMain Course,\u201d they reinvented the Bee Gees\u2019 sound with Latin and funk rhythms, electronic keyboards and vocals that owed a debt to Philadelphia soul. It brought the band its first hits in years: \u201cNights on Broadway\u201d and \u201cJive Talkin\u2019,\u201d which went to No. 1.\nFor many listeners, the Gibbs were the face of disco. Even \u201cSesame Street\u201d got caught up in the trend, with Robin singing on the disco-themed album \u201cSesame Street Fever.\u201d It went gold.\nThe Bee Gees\u2019 1979 album, \u201cSpirits Having Flown,\u201d produced three more No. 1 singles, \u201cToo Much Heaven,\u201d \u201cTragedy\u201d and \u201cLove You Inside Out.\u201d Then, in 1980, the band filed a $200 million lawsuit against Mr. Stigwood, saying he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract. They settled out of court and publicly reconciled.\nIn the \u201980s the band\u2019s popularity waned in the United States but remained strong abroad. Robin released three solo albums, with limited success. The Bee Gees returned with some moderate hits in the late 1990s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. With his brothers, Mr. Gibb won six Grammys.\nIn addition to his wife and his brother Barry, Robin Gibb is survived by his sons, Spencer and Robin-John, known as R J; his daughters, Melissa and Snow; a sister, Lesley; and his mother.

{"idx": 326, "truncated_input": "PARIS \u2013 French children go to school four days a week. They have about two hours each day for lunch. And they have more vacation than their counterparts almost anywhere in the West.\nIt may sound a bit like the famously leisurely work pace enjoyed by their parents, most of whom work 35 hours per week as dictated by law.\nBut the nation&apos;s new government says elementary school kids risk classroom burnout, and is moving to help them cope. The issue: French school days may be relatively few, but they are at least as long as a day of work for adults. Even 6-year-olds are in class until late into the afternoon, when skies are dark, attention flags and stomachs rumble.\nAs a candidate, President Francois Hollande promised to change things by adding a fifth day of classes on Wednesday while shortening the school day. For France, it&apos;s something of a revolutionary idea that would overturn more than a century of school tradition. The thinking is that the days are too full for young children under the current system and that Wednesday free time could be put to more productive use.\n\"France has the shortest school year and the longest day,\" Hollande said at the time, promising change.\nHis education minister, Vincent Peillon, will decide this month how to carry out the reform. He has said he may also compensate for a shorter school day by trimming France&apos;s sacred summer vacation. A panel of experts will present their conclusions on Friday, and the president is expected to address the issue on Tuesday.\nNo proposal affects tradition \u2014 and potentially family and municipal budgets \u2014 as much as what the French call changes to the \"scholastic rhythms.\"\nThere&apos;s been a midweek break in French primary schools dating back to the 19th century, a government concession to the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted children to study the catechism on their weekday off. In today&apos;s secular France, Wednesdays currently are a blur of sports, music, tutoring for families of means, or a scramble for working parents struggling to get by \u2014 who must either find a sitter or send their kids to a full day at a state-run \"leisure center.\"\nThings aren&apos;t exactly easy for French kids.\nDespite long summer breaks and the four-day school week, French elementary school students actually spend more hours per year in school than average \u2014 847, compared with 774 among countries in OECD, a club of wealthy nations. But the time is compressed into fewer days each year. The French school day begins around 8:30 and ends at 4:30 p.m., even for the youngest, despite studies showing the ability of young children to learn deteriorates as the day goes on.\nBut many parents are afraid that the changes will force them to figure out extra childcare five days a week, especially at schools where the afterschool program amounts to sitting silently at a desk for two hours or near-chaos in the play areas. Under the education proposal, school would end at lunchtime on Wednesday.\n\"It&apos;s completely unrealistic,\" Valerie Marty, president of the national parents&apos; organization, said of the proposed timetable. \"They have to figure out who will take care of the children after school, who will finance it.\"\nIn France, the answer is usually the government.\nThe state is expected to provide for just about everything education-related: Classes come under the national budget, and lunches and leisure are the domain of municipalities. So if school lets out most days at 3:30 p.m., under the plan most recently floated, more working parents than ever would need afterschool care \u2014 and towns would have to figure out what to do with restless children. That would almost certainly involve something more constructive than sitting quietly at desks, kicking around a ball, or playing cards until the evening when parents get out of work.\nThe Education Ministry has proposed more organized extracurricular activities like sports, theater and art to replace the relatively free form time children now have after school. But that means trained staff and, of course, more money from local budgets already strained in difficult economic times.\nMarty, who has three children, proposes something entirely different: lengthening lunch to three hours.\n\"After a meal, children have a moment when they&apos;re tired. They&apos;re not ready for intellectual activities and could do something more relaxing,\" she said, suggesting theater, or quiet time in a library for others. Afterward, she said, classes could resume until evening.\nTrimming the hallowed summer break is another tricky proposition. The school year ends at the beginning of July. Some families take July off, some August. But nearly everyone takes a month, and many French families travel for the entire period.\nPeillon said he was flexible about vacation time: \"If the question of vacation is blocking things, I&apos;ll propose that the prime minister leave it alone.\"\nEric Charbonnier, an OECD education expert supports the proposed changes. He believes the current system isn&apos;t working for the children most in need of a good education.\n\"A schedule with long days and lots of vacation is not one that will help the students who are having problems,\" he said.\nPeter Gumbel, a British journalist who has lived in France since 2002 and written a book about the country&apos;s education system, said the length of the school day is only", "baseline_completion": " part of the problem.

For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty \u2014 take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorgna said in a note.\n\"And if the Fed determines that it really wants to raise rates this year, the likely tightening in financial conditions that would accompany such a desire would give policymakers pause,\" he added. \"Therefore, we do not expect a rate hike until the March 2016 meeting at the earliest.\"\nSure, there's been a rebound of sort in the global equity markets, but even that only seems to exemplify how much investors have come to depend on monetary largess from the Fed and its global counterparts. The S&P 500 index had been in a sharp tumble around the time of the September meeting, falling more than 12 percent from its July peak until it cratered 12 days after the FOMC decision.\nSince then, the market is up nearly 10 percent, buoyed in part by hopes of a lower-for-longer Fed.\nSumming up the Faustian bargain between the two entities, Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote, \"Global weakness is OK for U.S. markets as long as the Fed refrains from hiking rates, and vice versa it would be OK from a markets perspective for the Fed to begin hiking rates if global weakness diminishes (but not OK if US data rebounds in isolation).\"\nMikkelsen added that it's important the", "baseline_completion": " Fed acknowledge that the U.S. growth story is deteriorating.\n\"Hence risk assets have rallied for three weeks prompted by the turn to weaker U.S. data that began with the weak September jobs report, as the Fed's rate decision is understood to be completely data dependent,\" he said. \"However, clearly for the market rally to be sustained it would be helpful if (the) FOMC statement tilted dovish by acknowledging this turn to weaker U.S. data.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1091, "prompt_length": 991, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": " Fed doesn't \"overreact\" to the latest data, which he said \"may be a bit too optimistic.\"\n\"The Fed is not going to raise rates in December, but it is going to raise rates in March,\" he said. \"The Fed is going to raise rates in March, and the market is going to react to that.\"\nThe Fed's next meeting is scheduled for December 15-16.\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a \u201ctruly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,\u201d the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe\u2019s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko\u2019s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements. The aim is to gain an understanding of just what went into the building of the synagogue and how its construction would have been envisaged and carried out \u2014 and also to lend authenticity to the replica.\n\u201cIt brings back the lost story of the synagogue, the town, this culture,\u201d said Patrick Goguen, a student at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\nThe project is occurring in several stages. Building the timber-framed roof and cupola is the first stage, running through June.

Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew. ''I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,'' Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents. ''I don't believe in conspiracy theories,'' he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for", "baseline_completion": " exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain.

He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bosh is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything.

Marc W over at USS Mariner take s a look at catching defense and trying to measure it.\nFor me, there aren't many ways to statistically measure catching defense. And of those ways -- throwing out runners, passed balls (don't you ever use catcher's ERA, ever) - that's about 1/10th of the responsibilities of the position. And because of that, any stat - namely Win Above Replacement player (WAR) - that uses a defensive metric is kind of flawed when it comes to catchers. So much of a catcher's responsibility cannot be measured or quantified with numbers. I was converted to catcher in college (ate my way out of second base), and played the position for three years. The amount of things that went into just one game were overwhelming - and that was at the NAIA level. So at the big league level? It's ridiculous. It's why I kind of just shrugged my shoulders on WAR comparisons of John Jaso and Mike Morse.\nOne thing that would be interesting is the 40-man roster move the Mariners would make if they sign Shoppach. Who do they designate for assignment? Would it be another young player like Yoervis Medina, or would the Mariners part ways with Mike Carp, who seems to have no place on the team.\nAs for other free agents.... outfielder Michael Bourn met with the Mets (see what I did there?). If you notice in the Sherman story, he views it as a long shot. Why? Well according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, Bourn's agent - Scott Boras - wants 5-years at $15 million per year. And if anyone knows what Boras wants, it would be Heyman.\nFrom what I've been told, there hasn't been a ton of discussion about Bourn in the Mariners' front office. I'm guessing the idea of $75 million is a little too much of a commitment, particularly with their push to sign Felix Hernandez to a contract extension. Of course, that could change if the asking price went down a little. But how often does Boras' asking price go down? Would Bourn help the Mariners? Yes.

Opara says he isn't quite so sure.\nBut a long injury history \u2014 and a look toward life after soccer \u2014 made it more than just a hasty reaction. He played only three games in 2014 before suffering a rare chondral defect in his right ankle.\n\"I've been through a lot with all the other injuries,\" he said. \"I wanted to be healthy for my life.\n\"And I felt like I couldn't catch a break. It was like, this again? I just wondered if it would be worth it to go through all that all over again.\"\nOpara spoke with his family and friends. He told them he was contemplating retirement \u2014 only two months after his 26th birthday and only days after national experts put him in the conversation for Major League Soccer's best defender.\nThen? A change of heart.\nIt came slowly. After undergoing a minimally-invasive surgery \u2014 a recently-developed procedure designed to expedite his return to the field \u2014 Opara learned his season wasn't over just yet. Doctors allowed for the possibility of a 2015 return. Maybe.\nA possibility is all he needed. He began rehab in the following weeks. The pain subsided more quickly than he expected. He regained the urge to join his teammates back on the field.\nAnd that's looking more and more likely by the day. Opara has returned to Sporting Kansas City practice, at least for the non-contact drills, with an eye toward returning to the field this season. His coach, Peter Vermes, expects it to happen \u2014 whether it be before the regular season concludes on Oct. 25 or sometime during the playoffs.\n\"That's always been the goal (since the diagnosis),\" Opara said. \"Obviously the way I've been progressing, for now, why not try to push and see where it goes? If we keep doing well as a team and hopefully make the playoffs and make a deep run, I see no reason why I wouldn't be available for that.\"\nThere are still hurdles to cross, of course. While Opara says his lateral movement is \"just as good, if not better\" than it was prior to the Achilles' tendon rupture, the linear movements are still a work in progress. He is noted for his athleticism \u2014 which makes him a dangerous aerial weapon \u2014 but his jumping ability hasn't fully returned yet.\nThere are signs it's close.\n\"Ike was in an exercise the other day. If you would've come out here and you didn't know the team, and I (told) you to pick that guy that you think is injured out there, you would never pick him,\" Vermes said. \"I can tell you that.\"\nEven so, Opara isn't near 90-minutes fit.

After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That\u2019s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road.

There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n\u201cEating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,\u201d he says.

Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows\u2019 milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,\u201d he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. \u201cIt contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. \u201cFresh milk is warm.

Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not \u201cpicture postcard perfect\u201d, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biof\u00e1n, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea ar\u00eate, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view.

In 2015, the 10th anniversary of the shootings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is taking another look at the case of Brian Nichols and the events around that violent day. 2015 Coverage: Brian Nichols shootings 10 years later.\nShe recounted the events of the night Nichols forced his way into her home on television two days later, and the nation saw the same calm demeanor and steady blue eyes that had soothed Nichols as he showered, ate, watched television and did his laundry after murdering four people. Days later when she returned to the scene, she discovered that in the time after he let her go and before the authorities arrived, he\u2019d hung a mirror she\u2019d been meaning to put up in her new apartment.\nToday, Ashley Smith Robinson \u2013 she married Daniel Robinson in June 2007 \u2013 says that was \u201cthe one event that really changed my life.\u201d She earns a living from speaking engagements, mainly before religious groups, retelling her ordeal and the self-transformation that followed.\nShe\u2019s also on track to complete the radiologic technology program at Lanier Tech in September. She someday hopes to do ultrasounds.\nBut people will always know her for the poise under pressure that led to the media moniker, the Atlanta Hostage Hero.\nSix months after the public first marveled at the details of March 12, with its bizarrely squeaky-clean images of scrambled eggs and the pair huddled over Rick Warren\u2019s \u201cThe Purpose Driven Life,\u201d a second wave of news stories added a different veneer. Smith Robinson\u2019s book about the ordeal, \u201cUnlikely Angel,\u201d revealed she\u2019d given Nichols a few lines of methamphetamine to snort from her stash.\nWhen Nichols pulled a gun on her outside Bridgewater Apartments in Duluth, Smith Robinson was trying to get her life back on track, kick meth and get a career going to prove to her family she was capable of being a mother.\nThe book showed that this pretty blond Georgia girl had a dark side of her own, a well she drew from to elicit compassion from Nichols. She writes about a past that includes drug-induced psychotic visions, hospitalization, sending her daughter, Paige, away to be raised by an aunt so she could have more time to party, and holding her first husband, Paige's father, in her arms as he died from a knife wound after a violent fight in a parking lot in 2001.\nBut that was then. Paige, 10, now lives with her mom, and Smith Robinson\u2019s post-Brian Nichols life seems safe and successful. She coaches Paige\u2019s basketball team, has learned to Scuba dive, runs marathons, attends classes and is active in her church.\nUntil now, she's spurned offers to make a movie about her life. But she\u2019s recently OK\u2019d preliminary plans with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d producer Ken Wales to make a Christian-themed movie about the event. She\u2019s not sure when it would be released.\nNichols himself predicted the windfall of positive change that would grow out of her time with him. She writes in her book that just before he let her go he said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to praise you and talk about how wonderful you are.\u201d Soon after, Nichols surrendered peacefully in front of Ashley\u2019s apartment and admitted his crimes.\nSmith Robinson immediately left Atlanta at that time and sought shelter with her aunt and uncle at their house in a gated community near Augusta.\n\u201cIt was very important that I went from one extreme to the other after that happened,\u201d she said. Her aunt, Kim Rogers, who had been raising Paige for the past three years, walked her through it all.\nWhen Smith Robinson talks about the night with Nichols, she says it was God, not her, who made the psychological maneuvers to relate to his outrage. On March 14, 2005, when she apologized on his behalf, she seemed in the odd position of serving as a bridge between the killer and his victims. She\u2019s since been in contact with immediate family members of all the victims, save one.\nShe\u2019s not sure yet if she'll ever have further contact with Nichols. She said she couldn\u2019t look at him during the five and a half hours she spent repeating the facts in the 2008 trial that led to his imprisonment with no chance of parole.\n\u201cFrom day one, I always said, \u2018God, if you want me to have anymore contact with this person whatsoever, I need for you to lay it heavy on my heart.'

The reformer whose unconventional thinking encourages the Soviet Union to transform itself, or a pushover for reac tionaries who want him to arrogate authority and save the Union at all costs? Americans have reason to wonder, and cause for concern. But they'd be wrong to ignore the continuing revolution in Soviet society amid the moment's political machinations.\nSoviet reformers are themselves uncertain of what to make of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly conservative behavior. Sensing a mood swing in Moscow, some actually applaud his efforts to restore order. Their hope is that he will thus tame the tiger of reaction and consolidate reform before renewing it. Others, like the most reform-minded of his inner circle, Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, warn of impending dictatorship. Yet even they have warm words for him.\nMr. Gorbachev's reformist critics fall into two camps. One is composed of radicals who favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. They, along with those who cheer them on from outside, call for Mr. Gorbachev's overthrow. But they've always underestimated his radicalism and his perseverance, while overestimating their own support.\nThe other camp consists of reformers who have grown disenchanted with the pace of change. They fear that he has been co-opted by apparatchiks who identify freer speech and markets with chaos.\nBut these critics do not include Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Yakovlev. The real enemy, they still say, is not Mr. Gorbachev but the forces of reaction deeply entrenched in Moscow's ministries, the security forces, Communist Party apparatus and regional military commands.\n\"We are witnessing the rise of a vengeful and merciless conservative wave,\" Mr. Yakovlev said last week. \"I'm extremely worried by the indifference and fatigue of the democratic forces.\"\nNow both he and Mr. Shevardnadze are on the outside looking in. And both may have lost power on what is now the central issue confronting Mr. Gorbachev -- how to reconstitute the Union.\nBoth men favor decentralization to allow reformers in the Russian Republic to plunge ahead, while republics in Central Asia proceed more slowly. And they want to cede more power to the republics as a way for leaders who favor the Union to head off independence movements. The exceptions are the Baltic republics; Mr. Yakovlev admits that they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, implying they eventually deserve independence.\nSuch fine distinctions seem to be lost on Mr. Gorbachev just now. The immediate task, as he sees it, is to restore order. And to do so he has turned to the bureaucracy, the military and the K.G.B.\nThe great fear -- not only in Moscow but also in Washington -- is that Mr. Gorbachev's alliance of convenience will restore the reactionaries and torpedo reform. That could happen.\nBut", "baseline_completion": " the social revolution has moved too far for any lasting return to the days of Stalin, or even Brezhnev.

{"idx": 401, "truncated_input": "CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, Hamilton County leaders laid out a bleak reality: The county has too many projects and no way to pay for them all.\nFrom an outdated convention center to the obsolete Western Hills Viaduct, Hamilton County Commissioners are trying to figure out how to pay for more than $1.5 billion worth of infrastructure, development, transportation and county building needs in the coming years.\n\"We have more projects than we have money,\" Hamilton County Commission President Todd Portune told a crowd of at least 150 people Tuesday night.\nAnd a battle over one of the few sources of money left -- a small slice of sales tax that becomes available in 2020, currently being used to pay for a renovation of Union Terminal -- is already brewing.\nPortune called the meeting Tuesday to gather public comments to help decide which projects the county should fund.\nFC Cincinnati's General Manager Jeff Berding led roughly 100 of the team's fans into the packed meeting, yelling \"Build it here.\" It's no surprise that Berding, a former Cincinnati city councilman, was able to organize the loudest and largest display of political pressure in the room.\nMore than 30 people weighed in on a range of projects, but most begged commissioners to help post the $100 million FC Cincinnati is requesting from taxpayers to build a $200 million MLS stadium in Cincinnati. The team is currently contending for a spot in the MLS, and Berding said he needs a stadium deal hammered out before the end of the year.\n\"We're not here to ask that you only support FC Cincinnati because we have many needs in this community,\" Berding told the three-member commission. \"But we're probably asking to be among the first, given the timeline of the decision.\"\nFC Cincinnati's ask to be first in line is still a big deal.\nThe county is grappling with an overcrowded jail, a dated courthouse and an aging Jobs and Family Services building -- all of which serve hundreds of county families. In 10 years, the county will be grappling with a $266 million maintenance backlog, Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto said.\nThe city's two current major league sports teams -- the Reds and the Bengals -- will eventually come knocking on the county's door for a new deal. The Bengals stadium lease with the county expires in 2026, and the Reds' lease expires a few years after. Combined, the two stadiums could need more than $200 million in upgrades within the next decade.\n\"While no one is talking about demoing these stadiums, we know there will be substantial maintenance (needs),\" Alutto said.\nCounty taxpayers will need to help pay for some of the $330 million overhaul of the Western Hills Viaduct. Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hubbard has proposed paying for some of that project with an additional $5 driver's license fee.\n\"It needs to be addressed and now,\" Portune said Tuesday.\nA $230 million upgrade of the Duke Energy Convention center is necessary to keep visitors -- and their money -- flowing into the city, experts say. Another $10 million renovation of Sharonville Convention Center is also needed, Sharonville's mayor said Tuesday.\nU.S. Bank Arena owners have asked the Port Authority to buy the deteriorating facility and for taxpayers to finance a $342 million demolition and rebuild it. The building's small and old conditions have caused the city to miss out on huge conventions, most notably the Republican National Convention last year, that would have pumped millions of dollars into the city's economy.\n\"It allows Cincinnati and the county to compete,\" said Nederlander Entertainment COO Ray Harris. \"We're willing to work with anybody to try and make Cincinnati better.\nThe Banks, which taxpayers have already invested $135 million to carve out on Ohio's river, remains unfinished.\nMeanwhile, any money that would be used to pay for these projects is nearly tapped out.\nCounty is painting a bleak picture here for available $. Hotel tax - tapped. Sales tax - a quarter left. None = new stadium or arena.\nThe county can't collect any more hotel tax. Parking revenues generated from garages at The Banks are being used to pay down the debt on those garages. And the county can only legally collect a quarter percent more in sales tax, which would mean buyers pay 7.25 percent on every purchase, bringing in roughly $38 million every year. Hamilton County currently charges a 7 percent sales tax.\nThat little room to fund even one or two of the projects discussed Tuesday.\n\"There is not now, and never will be, enough money to ever fund every major capital project that is before you for consideration,\" said Tim Mara, a Cincinnati attorney and government watchdog who led the charge against a tax increase to pay for Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park more than 20 years ago.\nMara was one of a few speakers who urged commissioners to oppose any taxpayer funding for a new FC Cincinnati stadium.\n\"It makes no sense to divert scarce money to building a soccer stadium when these vital needs remain unfunded,\" he said.\nCommissioners are bracing for a fight over the quarter percent sales tax increase, currently used to pay for a restoration of Union Terminal, that expires in 2020. That sales tax generates roughly $38 million every year.

They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the shortcomings with APM 1.0 tools that make them unfit for today\u2019s applications.\nCustomers have been managing application performance since early days of mainframe evolution. However, Application Performance Management as a discipline has gained popularity in the past decade.\nLet me first introduce what I mean by APM 1.0. The enterprise applications and technologies such as Java have evolved in past two decades. The APM 1.0 tools were invented more than a decade back and they provided great benefits to resolve application issues that were prevalent with the early versions of Java and.NET technologies. However Java/.NET application servers have become mature and do not have those challenges any more. Also enterprise application architecture and technologies have changed drastically and the APM 1.0 tools have not kept up. The following figure shows the evolution of enterprise Java in the past 15 years and when APM 1.0 and APM 2.0 tools have started emerging.\nFollowing are few challenges with the APM 1.0 tools that you will run into when trying to manage your enterprise applications.\nThe application owner and the application support team primarily cares about the user experience and service level delivered by their applications. APM 1.0 tools were primarily built to monitor applications from an application infrastructure perspective.\nThese tools lack the capabilities to monitor applications from real user perspective and help you isolate application issues whether it is caused by the network, load balancers, ADNs such as Akamai, or the application, database, etc. Some of these solutions were quick to add some basic end-user monitoring capabilities such as synthetic monitoring. However an application support personnel has to switch between multiple consoles and depend on manual correlation between end-user monitoring and application deep dive monitoring tools.\nThese tools do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. That means you are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nAPM 1.0 deep-dive monitoring tools were primarily built to diagnose issues during the application development lifecycle. These tools morphed into production deep-dive monitoring tools when the need arose for APM in production environments. So, These tools were not optimized for production monitoring and hence require a lot of effort to tune for production.\nFirst off, the complexities of agent installation and configuration hinder deployment in production environment. Second, these tools usually require configuration changes every time new application code is rolled out.\nMost damagingly, they have high overhead on application performance and do not scale beyond 100-150 application servers. This means that most customers use these in a test environment or enable deep-dive monitoring retroactively after an application failure - assuming the problem will recur.\nFinally, these tools do not provide operation friendly UIs and because they were originally built for developers.\nAs I alluded earlier, the old generation APM tools are very complex to configure because these require application knowledge, manual instrumentation and complex agent deployment. Hence expensive consultants are required to deploy and configure and maintain these tools. These tools also have multiple consoles - adding to total cost of ownership. Some customers told me that they spend a lot of time managing these APM tools", "baseline_completion": " rather than being able to manage their applications.\nThese tools were built more than a decade back, and have not evolved much although the application architecture, technologies and methodologies have gone though drastic changes.\nAPM 1.0 tools certainly cannot satisfy these needs.

By the time he left, he had more than $500,000.\nThe Ooltewah lawyer raised more than $370,000 Friday afternoon alone.\nFor perspective, in 2013 and 2014 combined, Fleischmann raised a total of $1.6 million.\nThe purse was the biggest Fleischmann has ever collected at one time.\n\"This time, I am making sure we have the financial wherewithal early, so we can defend any primary challenge,\" Fleischmann said after the event. \"I'd prefer to have no primary challenger, but I'll be ready.\"\nFleischmann has never had an easy primary run in three elections to date.\nLast year, he eked out a win against then-27-year-old Republican challenger Weston Wamp, son of former Rep. Zach Wamp. Fleischmann won the race with 51 percent of the vote to Wamp's 49 percent.\nAnd in 2012, he battled the younger Wamp and Athens, Tenn., dairy icon Scotty Mayfield in the primary. Fleischmann got 39 percent of the vote, Mayfield got 31 percent and Wamp pulled 29 percent.\nHis first run in 2010 was a six-candidate scrum.\nMcCarthy said Friday the Tennessee Republican has been \"very effective\" for the 3rd District by getting funding for Oak Ridge National Laboratory and helping to move things along at the Chickamauga lock from his coveted spot on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen someone get on that [committee] faster than our own Chuck Fleischmann,\" he told the crowd.\nNo one has officially announced a campaign to challenge Fleischmann in the 2016 primary, but politicos have nodded toward state Sen. Bo Watson. And Watson hasn't denied the rumors.\nIn March, Watson said he was focusing on his job in session, not a campaign.

In response, some Catholic bishops and commentators have told CNA that they don\u2019t believe these groups\u2019 concerns resonate with those of the Church.\nThe discussion between the Obama transition team and the different representatives touched on international development and trade, health care reform, reducing abortions, immigration, domestic policy and poverty reduction, and the environment.\nThe meeting of the 14 different organizations was organized by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and the lobbying group \u201cNetwork,\u201d which describes itself as \"a progressive voice within the Catholic community\" that lobbies Congress on justice and peace issues.\nSr. Simone Campbell, director of Network, told the National Catholic Reporter that the meeting was called to \"acknowledge the work that some of the Catholic groups had done in the Catholic community during the election and to begin to develop relationships for \u2018post-Jan. 20,\u2019 when the new administration takes over after Obama\u2019s inauguration.\"\nJames Salt, Organizing Director of Catholics United, explained to CNA that Catholics United participated in the meeting by highlighting \"key policies that are important to Catholics.\n\"Specifically we want the new administration to take seriously its commitment to reduce abortions in America. People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\"\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \"We're hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these \u2018Platform for the Common Good\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \u201cBeing 'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves 'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\u2019s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his", "baseline_completion": " Cabinet selections thus far.

The best Moto Mods are pricey, as are these phones. The cameras are acceptable, but still need work.\nA lot of Android phones claim to be different, but Motorola\u2019s Z series backs up that claim. Love \u2018em or hate \u2018em, the Moto Z phones have something that other phones just don\u2019t. The new Moto Z2 Force and Moto Z2 Play have magnetic Mods that snap onto the back of them, adding new features. What you think about those Mods will determine whether either of the two Moto Z2 phones are right for you.\nWhatever you\u2019re doing, Moto wants to have a Mod for that. Snap on a battery pack if you\u2019re going off grid, or maybe a 360-degree camera so you can capture everything on that nature hike. Pop on a speaker and you can pump up the jams, or attach Motorola\u2019s brand new Polaroid printer Mod that lets you instantly print out any photo you take. You can even buy a Mod that turns your phone into an Amazon Echo speaker, complete with a glowing blue ring.\nThere are more than a dozen of these Mods, and they all magnetically cling to the back of the rather svelte Z2, which feels almost too thin and flat without one. Moto Mods are the defining reason to buy a Moto Z2 Play and its more expensive sibling, the Z2 Force. But they don\u2019t come cheap. Many of these doodads cost upward of a hundred bucks.\nMy Moto Z2s have worn a lot of Mods in the last few weeks. I found most of them fun, but I didn\u2019t want to keep any of them snapped on forever. Many of them make the phone a little too fat. My favorite was a battery pack, which I kept in my back and snapped on whenever I had a long day ahead of me. Oddly, I rarely needed it. Both the Z2 Force and Play get excellent battery life without augmentation. I was able to use the Z2 Play for two days straight after forgetting to charge it, though it was gasping for a charge by the second evening. That kind of battery life is hard to come by these days.\nBoth Moto Z2 phones are nearly identical from the outside. They have large glass 5.5-inch screens above a nice fingerprint sensor. The sides and back are smooth, brushed aluminum with a large circular bump for the rear camera. Ridges on the power button make it easy to distinguish from the volume keys, all of which sit on the right side of the phone. Charging via the USB C slot on the bottom is also pretty standard.\nInitially, I was bothered by how flat the back of the phone feels. It doesn\u2019t contour to your palm like some phones. After a few days, I got used to it and now appreciate how thin these phones feel, though I still recommend a bumper case, like this one from Lenovo.\nSetting aside the lack of waterproofing on either phone, the only problem with the design is that it\u2019s large for one-handed use. This is an extra-large phone, and if that bothers you, consider the smaller and cheaper Moto X4.\nBoth phones also run Motorola\u2019s slight twist on Android 7 Nougat (the new Android 8 Oreo is promised, but not out yet). Most of what\u2019s here is identical to other Android phones, but there are a few Moto Action gestures that I like to use. You can twist the phone to open the camera and swipe it down and up like you\u2019re swinging an ax to turn on and off the flashlight. Even better are the home button gestures, which let you dump the onscreen back, home, and multitasking buttons in favor of swiping left, right, and pressing on the home button. It takes a good day to get used to it, but swiping is very intuitive, and a great reason to stick with a phone with a home button fingerprint sensor, like this one.\nThe 12-megapixel rear cameras perform similarly, as well. I snapped some lovely night photos on a trip to New York City, and the camera did a decent job balancing dark areas and bright Christmas light displays at Saks Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center. The Moto Z2 Play has been my go-to camera for three weeks now. Despite what feels like a second of lag when pressing the shutter button, it hasn\u2019t hampered my ability to take timely shots. The 5-megapixel front camera on each is decent, but has had some trouble in low-light situations. The rear camera\u2019s 4K (30fps) video support is also nice. If you\u2019re picky about your photos though, neither of these can match the shooters on the new iPhone X or Pixel 2.\nBoth Z2 models will work on most wireless carriers, have 64GB storage (with MicroSD slots), and 4GB of RAM. Still, there are a few vital differences between these phones that I\u2019m going to sum up quickly.\nThe Z2 Force is the fancier $720 version. It has an extra rear camera (that, to be honest, does not add a whole lot to the experience), a cutting-edge Snapdragon 835 processor (this does speed the phone up substantially if you use intense apps or games), and a higher-resolution Quad HD screen that will supposedly withstand falls better. It also comes with a \"Shattershield\" screen cover stuck on it that\u2019s sharp around the edges. What you lose is a headphone jack and a few hours of battery life. It\u2019s also imperceptibly thicker.\nThe Moto Z2 Play has a weaker Snapdragon 626 processor, larger battery, FM radio, and standard HD screen. I was legitimately shocked when I found out both screens had a different resolution, which shows just how adequate a 1080p screen still is. Both Super AMOLED displays look excellent.\nI still like having a headphone jack and the slightly slower performance of the Moto Z2 Play is an easy tradeoff for the savings. The $500 64GB Unlocked version of the Moto Z2 Play is my favorite model (linked in the Buy buttons on this review), though there is a Verizon-only edition for $408", "baseline_completion": ".\nThere are a few truly high-end phones you can buy for $500 or less, like the OnePlus 5T or Essential Phone, but neither of them have Moto Mods.

I fielded enough questions regarding Kyle Lauletta that we were interested in seeing him.

He also declined to commit to a backup quarterback when asked Friday.\nAsked if he saw anything encouraging from Lauletta beyond the box score, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shula succinctly said, \"Yeah, he got experience.\"\nThe Giants still are alive in the NFC playoff race and can't be eliminated this weekend if they beat the Titans.

{"idx": 433, "truncated_input": "The Solar Decathlon is a wonderful idea, where teams from all over the world compete to design the most energy-efficient buildings which are, of course, solar powered. Most have tended to be the size of mobile homes, so that they can be built at the universities and shipped to the decathlon, and then shipped home. Most entries act like mobile homes, being detached buildings that will stand alone.\nThe DPD is a uniquely syncretic product of our study of two proven traditional housing typologies born of different cultures. The row house typology, typical of Montreal\u2019s urban fabric, accommodates single-family scenarios in a long and narrow low-rise form. The Siheyuan courtyard house demonstrates an environmentally and culturally specific approach to city dwelling of great historic, social, and functional value.\nThe DPD is also designed to the Passive House standard, which can be a challenge in a city like Montreal; there is a reason that an unofficial anthem for Quebec is Gilles Vigneault\u2019s \u201cMon pays, ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver\u201d (My country is not a country, it's winter). So it has a lot of insulation, an energy recovery ventilation system, and is designed for serious air-tightness.

A press release says that it is a \u201cPassive House-inspired design\u201d.\nAnother feature of the house is that it is prefabricated.\nA key innovation of the DPD is the utilization of off-site (factory) prefabrication methods of construction. It is designed for both modular & panelized options. Prefabrication addresses issues of affordability, reduction of waste, health and safety of workers, greater export capacity, and quality control to achieve high-performance building standards. Quebec\u2019s prefabrication industry is one of the most robust in North America and its expansion into the high-performance building industry is a key to its development.\nBut they are not doing Passive House quality prefabs in Quebec yet, so the team turned to Ecocor in Maine, which builds houses from Passive House quality panels.

He said the system with which he had become identified had no future. Whether motivated by conscience or survival, his unexpected resignation elicited wild cheers and seemed to signal the beginning of the end for black township governments.\nMr. Boya, who is 39 years old, said the handwriting appeared on the wall after the African National Congress was made legal and Nelson Mandela released in February. \"I realized there was no room any more for a person to serve in a structure created by the Government,\" he said.\nHis decision to quit, he said, was prompted by his inability to stop the state-owned power company from switching off Daveyton's electricity for four days recently because of unpaid bills. He said it illustrated the frustrations he had faced in Daveyton since joining its town council in 1978.\n\"The weakness of the black local authorities was simply lack of funds, lack of local sources of revenue,\" Mr. Boya said. But, he quickly added, \"the structures were illegitimate\" because the white minority Government had imposed them on blacks.\nTheir resources are not shared with the satellite black townships, which began as stark dormitories for blacks working at menial jobs in white areas and which suffer chronic poverty and unemployment.\nAnti-apartheid civic associations have organized boycotts of rent and utility payments to protest inferior living conditions, which deprive municipal governments of the modest revenue upon which they depend. The associations have accused municipal officials like Mr. Boya of being puppets of apartheid.\nSatisfied that the crisis had been resolved, Mr. Boya flew to Rio de Janeiro for a conference. In his absence, the deal collapsed when the Transvaal Provincial Administration insisted that most of the money paid go to pay municipal wages and only a little to the utility company.

{"idx": 435, "truncated_input": "ZTE, Huawei: Can China ever become a true innovation powerhouse? A Future Tense event.\nWill China\u2019s Scientists and Technologists Ever Be Truly Innovative?\nFrom left: Adam Segal, Denis Simon, Yifei Sun, and Steve LeVine.\nJust this week, a House of Representatives committee issued a report warning the United States against doing business with two major Chinese tech firms, ZTE and Huawei. The companies were closely tied to the Chinese government, the report said, and could be stealing information from the U.S. government and American businesses.\nIn opening remarks, Steve LeVine, Washington correspondent for Quartz magazine and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow, established the questions for the day: Can China ever become an \u201cinnovation juggernaut,\u201d just as it is a world leader in manufacturing? Does \u201cinnovation\u201d have to mean breakthroughs, or is incremental innovation\u2014small tweaks on Western-made technology to make it cheaper and sometimes better\u2014enough? And should the rest of the world be worried?\n-Creativity isn\u2019t encouraged: Segal argued that while we focus on the \u201chardware\u201d\u2014the more tangible results of innovation, like patents filed\u2014China needs to focus on the \u201csoftware\u201d problems of culture. In China, researchers aren\u2019t urged to think creatively, nor do they feel free to fail. \u201cNo risk, no reward\u201d may be a clich\u00e9, but it is also a truism.\n-Quantity is valued over quality: According to Huang, the number of journal articles published by Chinese researchers has exploded in recent years. But outside of the life sciences and biology, the level of impact from this research has remained fairly flat\u2014indicating that the research is not high-quality. In part, this may be because researchers are paid per publication, so repetitive research and short-term work is incentivized.\n-Intellectual property rights are not respected: Since patents and copyrights are frequently violated, there is less incentive to create.\nChina\u2019s leadership understands all of these things, said Segal. In fact, they have probably visited Silicon Valley \u201cmore than anyone,\u201d he joked. Accordingly, China\u2019s 2006 mid- to long-term plan for science and technology development emphasized the need for better intellectual property protection, for startup culture. But politically, introducing these elements will be very difficult\u2014especially, as Simon noted, because the politicians have other significant worries on their minds, like domestic protests.

At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure.

{"idx": 445, "truncated_input": "The black, glossy background in the Nike store took attention away from the brand's shoes.\nIn February, I visited Nike and Adidas' flagship stores in New York City.\nNike's displays were confusing, and the store didn't do enough to highlight the striking visuals that have always been one of the company's strengths.\nAdidas' design instincts were much better, and the store found a number of smart ways to allow customers to interact with products.\nThe rivalry between Nike and Adidas has been one of the top stories in athletic apparel for decades. While Nike has often landed bigger athletes for sponsorships, Adidas has surged in recent years by anticipating and responding to customer demand with stylish, versatile products that make sense for exercise or everyday use.\nNow, Nike is rethinking its retail approach in an attempt to keep Adidas from overtaking it as the top-selling athletic apparel company in the United States.\nI started at Niketown on 5th Avenue. Niketown was previously Nike's flagship store in New York City, but it closed in the spring and was replaced by a new store in November.\nThe first floor played to Nike's strengths.\nNike's acclaimed print and television ads have long played up its eye for striking visuals. Niketown's first floor reflected that skill set by highlighting images rather than products, creating excitement before customers even saw any merchandise.\nIt also promoted an inclusive, culturally relevant message. Nike's \"Equality\" ad campaign promoted diversity and tolerance.\nMost of the products shown on the first floor were inspired by that message. The items associated with the \"Equality\" campaign were some of the best I saw in the store.\nUnfortunately, the product displays (and many of the products themselves) on the other floors didn't quite live up to the hype. The store didn't have a consistent aesthetic, and many of the displays failed to highlight \u2014 and sometimes even detracted from \u2014 Nike's products.\nThe glossy black background on this display drew attention to its reflective qualities rather than the shoes.\nBasketball shoes have long been one of Nike's signature products, but Nike made some confusing decisions with its basketball shoe displays.\nPlacing a shoe off-center in the middle of a net-less basketball rim made the shoe line designed for LeBron James \u2014 perhaps Nike's most recognizable American athlete who isn't retired \u2014 look cheap rather than aspirational.\nIt didn't help that many of the shoes themselves were unattractive.\nIt would be difficult to make the raised, scale-like texture on Nike's \"Lebron 15\" shoe line look desirable in any environment. Considering the clout that Air Jordans still have with sneaker enthusiasts, it's surprising how badly Nike missed the mark with products associated with an athlete who will likely become one of the brand's most legendary icons.\nOne of Niketown's biggest problems was that it didn't consistently take advantage of Nike's best assets.\nThroughout its history, Nike has been able to land elite athletes for sponsorships more consistently than its competitors. But Niketown didn't do enough to highlight those athletes. This Lebron James display was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't reflected in the store's overall strategy.\nSome displays hinted at a strategy the store should have adopted.\nThis display for soccer shoes did a great job of creating an environment where the products could stand out, while complementing the products with eye-catching visuals of elite athletes. If Nike had applied this formula throughout the store, it may have been more compelling.\nBut more often than not, Nike wasted opportunities to show off the qualities that make it stand out from its competitors. I was drawn to the framed, black-and-white photos on each floor, but they were placed near the elevators and away from the merchandise.\nI went to Adidas' Fifth Avenue store next. Adidas opened the 45,000-square-foot store in December 2016.\nAdidas' flagship store also had a notable entrance. The Adidas store was designed with sports stadiums in mind, and the entrance was meant to look like the tunnel some athletes walk through before games. Like Niketown, the Adidas' store's entrance emphasized design over product.\nThe Adidas store had a more subtle and effective strategy for showing off its products, often placing shoes against walls with muted colors and using small, rectangular posters to separate the shoes into smaller groups that were easy to visually process.\nThe products were better, too. Adidas has gained an edge on competitors with its \"lifestyle running\" shoes, which are more stylish than the typical running shoe and are often worn as fashion accessories.\nNo matter their purpose, Adidas' shoes looked way better than anything Nike had to offer, often using sleeker designs, more sensible color schemes, and versatile textures that made sense for exercise and everyday use.\nThe store also highlighted the customer's ability to customize its products.\nThe second floor had a section that appealed to more creative types. Situated in the middle of the floor, the custom-design display wasn't intrusive, but it was obvious enough to draw the attention of a customer who might be interested in designing a custom shoe.\nCustomers could then make and order their own designs in the store.\nThe computers weren't quite as intuitive as they could be \u2014 they didn't indicate that users were supposed to scroll down at the beginning instead of clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen \u2014 but they were a smart way to engage customers who liked the brand's designs but weren't entirely satisfied with the color combinations available in the store.\nThe store also emphasized interactivity in creative ways.\nRather than only using a treadmill for customers who wanted to try out shoes (there was a treadmill available on the bottom floor), the second floor had a test track where customers could use clip-on sensors that would analyze their strides and allow salespeople to give them customized recommendations. The track was a smart way to encourage customers to reach out to salespeople, rather than the other way around.\nThe store allowed customers test out products in non-running contexts as well. On the bottom floor, a testing area with soccer balls and other sports equipment let customers get a sense of how products might work in sport-specific contexts.\nBetween the first and second floors, there were two sets of bleachers where people could watch sports while their friends, family members, or significant others shopped.\nBy integrating the bleachers into the staircase, they gave non-shoppers a place to hang out without getting in the way of customers.\nOverall, Adidas was the clear winner.\nI've preferred Nike to Adidas products for most of my life, so I was surprised by how impressed I was by the", "baseline_completion": " Adidas store. While it wasn't quite as flashy as its entrance indicated, it excelled where it mattered: in smart, carefully designed product displays and creative spaces where customers could test products in a wide variety of contexts.

An Israeli museum is built over a centuries old Muslim graveyard. Ancient olive trees, the livelihood of Palestinian farmers are burned. Homes are bulldozed. A blockade prevents goods from coming into and out of Palestine, inhibiting commerce and the means for a livelihood. Water is diverted from its source directly to Israel where it is abundantly available, including for swimming pools, while Palestinians have to buy water from tanker trucks.

{"idx": 450, "truncated_input": "When Thanksgiving preparations are concerned, I favor recipes that can be cooked ahead. The only thing I make on Thanksgiving day is the turkey. This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store \u2013 for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms \u2013 my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the \u201ckeepers,\u201d which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers \u2013 Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the \u201cEpi Clipper,\u201d tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad \u2013 this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food. But I will never forget the pain of watching a guest who obviously did not like this soup. He swirled it around in the bowl with his spoon, taking tiny mouthfuls, and washing them down with big gulps of water, until I swooped down and took the bowl right out from under his lifted spoon.\nAnother thing you need to know about this recipe is that although it is one of my keepers, it takes many hours to prepare. One guest who asked for the recipe later told me that she decided it was easier just to eat it at my house than to make it herself.\nIn my march (actually it was more of a crawl) towards a paper-less kitchen, I had less success with another New York Times recipe that is one of my Thanksgiving keepers: Cranberry-Pineapple Chutney, which by the way, can be made several weeks ahead and kept in a jar in your refrigerator. This recipe was part of a 1988 story, \u201cWhere Do Cranberries Come From, Anyway? The Answers.\u201d When I used Epi Clipper, the only ingredient that appeared was a pinch of salt. I took this snafu with a grain of salt, entered the rest of the ingredients manually on my desktop, and then synced the Epicurious account on my iDevices.\nThe app was of no help with the various sources of instructions for cooking the perfect turkey. Trussing is critical to this effort, and I continue to rely on the diagram (it\u2019s actually for trussing a chicken, but a turkey has the same basic anatomy) on pages 237-239 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, by Julia Child et al. (My copy of the book falls open to this page.) Other tips, from Bobby Flay, were originally published in the Nov. 22, 2002 issue of Newsweek, and are summarized here.\nAnother recipe that will not migrate to my iDevices is my grandmother\u2019s famous noodle pudding. As a child, I used to help her make it. First she let me crush the Sugar Frosted Flakes that she used for topping. When I got older, I was promoted to the job of running the KitchenAid mixer as she added the eggs, sugar and other ingredients.\nI still have a yellow index card, written in an insecure adolescent\u2019s script, with the recipe that she dictated to me.

The intellectual efforts to describe and understand this awareness become what we often call theology.\nSell, I think your whole argument falls down because the Christian church believes that God becaome flesh in the form of Jesus.

In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a slight decline in the number of black men applying to and enrolling in medical school from 1978 to 2014, a finding unique among all demographic groups. The numbers of black men in law, business, academia and engineering are also disproportionately low.\nThe AAMC report describes some of the persistent barriers: underperforming K-12 education, lack of positive role models, negative or limiting public perceptions of African-American men. For decades, any listing of prominent African-American men would almost exclusively contain athletes and other entertainers.\nThese perceptions all too often become reality. I grew up in the 1980s in a working-class black neighborhood near Washington where sports and entertainment framed our dreams. I can\u2019t remember anyone aspiring to become an astronaut or engineer or a senator or governor. Many of us did play competitive sports in high school, and a handful made it to the college level (me included). But only one went to the pros; the rest had to face the reality of finding regular jobs. Some had serious struggles with this transition. While we encouraged one another to practice our jump shots and perfect the art of throwing and catching a football, spending more time on the education road would have surely been a better strategy.\nLet\u2019s be honest, though. Becoming Barack Obama or Ben Carson is just as unlikely as becoming Michael Jordan or LeBron James. The difference is the process and where you\u2019ll land if you fall short of their status. While going to law school (like Obama) or medical school (like Carson) isn\u2019t likely to land you anywhere near the White House, it can lead to a very comfortable life. The average annual salary for a physician, which can be earned for 30 or 40 years, is over $200,000.\nPutting all of one\u2019s efforts into sports has enabled the exceptional few to become rich while leaving the majority with resum\u00e9s ill-suited to economic success.

There\u2019s a fascinating mix of research projects on display here which really brings home the difference that good research can make to individual patients.\nThe impact of the facilities and networks are evident already. For example, Ireland was at the forefront in testing Oncotype DX, a genetic diagnostic that helps women and their doctors determine the best course of individualised treatment in breast cancer and which helps patients avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.\nIreland also led a trial which examined 1,100 babies experiencing growth restriction in the womb. The study changed international guidelines when it found that intervention to prevent serious health complications for a small baby in the womb is only required for those in the bottom 3% from a weight perspective, not the bottom 10% as previously thought.

Tarzia, first elected to the Board of Finance in 1987, had been battling several ethics violation charges at the time of his departure.\nOne charge, filed by Human Resources Generalist Tania Barnes in April 2010, alleged Tarzia asked two city employees, Director of Operations Ernie Orgera and Parks Superintendent Mickey Docimo, to intervene in the disciplining of a vehicle maintenance worker.\nAnother complaint, filed by City Fleet Manager Michael Scacco, alleged Tarzia, along with City Rep. Sal Gabriele, R-16, and Republican finance board member Bob Kolenberg, \"led a campaign of harassment and retaliation\" against him after he attempted to discipline city equipment mechanic James Fasoli.\nThe city's deal with Tarzia ended public ethics hearings on the complaints. The arrangement was a settlement of a federal lawsuit Tarzia had filed against the city in October 2010, Larobina said.\nAn ethical dilemma: Who should pay?\nTarzia was paid $45,000 in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, resigning from municipal office, and withdrawing all ethics complaints and Freedom of Information requests he had filed.\n\"In my mind, it was simply a question of stemming the hemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars to defend and pay legal fees to outside counsel to defend this frivolous lawsuit, that, in our opinion had no merit,\" Larobina said. \"The decision was that we would spend more money litigating and defending this suit than we would to settle it. And we do that every day. We settle lawsuits every day.\"\nCommittee Chair Eileen Heaphy asked Larobina how much money he estimated the settlement saved taxpayers.\n\"I'm sure that we would have expended at least twice or three times the amount of what we paid out in legal fees,\" Larobina said. \"The case really hadn't gone very far at that point. We spent a significant amount of money.\"\nA breakdown of the more than $130,000 Stamford has spent on legal fees related to the past year's ethics proceedings shows the city paid the Law Office of Byelas & Neigher $42,390 for legal representation related to the federal lawsuit, in addition to the $45,000 settlement. It also spent an estimated $30,000 on legal fees incurred by the Board of Ethics in connection with the complaint filed against Tarzia and Kolenberg.\nArthur Layton, the committee vice chair, asked Larobina if the settlement stipulated Tarzia could not run for municipal office again or speak adversely about the city following his resignation. Larobina said the agreement did not include these requirements.\nCity Rep. Jay Fountain, D-7, asked about the status of the ethics complaints filed against Tarzia. Larobina said they had been withdrawn.\n\"Contrary to what some people have suggested, if you look at the ordinance, the Board of Ethics only has what we call in the law jurisdiction over individuals if they are a city employee, officer or elected official,\" Larobina said. \"Once you cease to become one of those things, the board has no jurisdiction over you.\"\nThe Stamford Code of Ethics section on \"continuing investigations,\" however, gives the Board of Ethics jurisdiction to pursue ethics inquiries even after the person in question has left a position with the city.\n\"If an officer or employee under investigation leaves office or employment, the Board by a majority vote shall have the power to continue the investigation,\" the Code says.\nHeaphy said she was glad Larobina clarified the circumstances surrounding the settlement.\n\"I think that the important thing was getting it on the record and in the open,\" she said. \"I think they did a fair and honest job with it. They came to a conclusion that saved the city a lot more problems, so I have to say that was wise on their part.\"\nCity Rep. Harry Day, R-13, said he was happy with Larobina's explanation.\n\"I'm a lawyer also and if I had been in Mike's shoes, I would have done exactly what he did,\" Day said. \"It was a deal that was premised on here we are, and let's just resolve where we are. It didn't look back, it didn't look forward. It just resolved what was in front of them.\"\nLarobina also answered questions from committee remembers regarding his department's stance on providing legal representation to city officials accused of ethics violations. Last spring, the city paid $3,000 for an attorney for Tarzia before deciding he would be responsible for his own legal fees unless he was cleared of the ethics charges against him.\n\"Initially Mr. Tarzia made a demand for his legal representation to be paid by the city,\" Larobina said. \"Our initial position was that we would do that. Upon my insistence, I gathered the senior attorneys in the law department and asked for further research on this matter.\"\nLarobina said he spent four or five hours researching the issue with three other attorneys in his office. They concluded the city was not legally obligated to provide upfront legal representation for city officials accused of ethics violations.\n\"We made a decision to change course,\" he said. \"Practicing attorneys do this all the time. You take a position, you do further research, you reflect and you decide that you're going to go in a different direction.\"\nCity Rep. John Zelinsky, D-11, said he was concerned volunteer elected officials would be deterred from serving on Stamford boards and commissions if they felt they could be liable for large legal expenses.\n\"What's to stop somebody from filing an ethics complaint against anybody... and we have to go out and retain an attorney to defend us possibly in a suit that really has no merit?\" Zelinsky said.\nLarobina said the issue would need to be taken up with the state Legislature.\n\"As your legal representation, let me tell you what your options are,\" he said. \"You need to address this with the Connecticut General Assembly. Those are your options.\"\nBoard of Ethics Chair Dan Young said Wednesday he intends to address the subject at Thursday's meeting, which will be held in part to discuss possible recommendations for improvements to the ethics code.\n\"I don't know what other board members will think, but I intend to raise the issue of", "baseline_completion": " whether we should recommend to the Board of (Representatives) that they make a rule about when/whether participants get their attorneys' fees paid for,\" Young said in an email.\nThursday's Board of Ethics meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Board of Representatives, legislative chambers at the Government Center.

{"idx": 464, "truncated_input": "The world of technology, particularly medical technology, tends to be consumed with making us superhuman. It wants to enhance our abilities and prolong our lives, if not enable us to live forever. But new innovations give rise to new and tough choices, and a small but growing group of startups sees it as their mission to use technology, not to extend life, but to help people make and document some of the most difficult decisions regarding the end of it.\nThe story of a patient from her days as a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine particularly haunts Azalea Kim, co-founder of the startup TrueNorth. A 60-year-old woman, who had terminal cancer, came to the emergency room one weekend evening in dire condition. Because of a complicated family situation, Kim said, she arrived alone, without any family member to serve as an advocate and describe the kind of care she would want.\nAlthough her medical record was overflowing with documentation, the doctors were unable to locate a health care proxy form that could also have provided guidance on the kind of procedures the woman would \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t \u2013 have wanted in her final days. So, Kim explained, the doctors slipped into default mode, administering intravenous therapy, sending her to a radiologist, considering a surgical intervention and providing all kinds of aggressive and potentially unwanted care.\nPartly motivated by that experience, Kim and two Harvard Business School classmates, Margaret Terry and Amy Flaster, launched TrueNorth. A recent graduate of the Healthbox startup accelerator in Boston, TrueNorth provides a free online service for patients to record their legal healthcare proxy (or power of attorney) and then share it with loved ones and healthcare providers.\nThe goal, the founders said, is for TrueNorth to encourage patients to tackle difficult end-of-life decisions and ultimately integrate with electronic medical record systems to make these forms available in the health and emergency contexts in which they\u2019re needed.\nA planning tool on MyDirectives prompts patients to indicate their preferences and values related to end-of-life care.\nAnd it\u2019s one of a handful of relatively new startups trying to use technology to help patients think through and share their end of life decisions. For example, along with TrueNorth, the Dallas-based MyDirectives exclusively offers support around health-related decisions, while startups Everplans and AfterSteps focus on medical planning services, along with a wider range of financial and legacy planning options.\nAccording to Kim, just 25 percent of patients have documented a health care proxy or living will. And, other estimates indicate that even when a document exists, it can\u2019t be located 35 percent of the time. These companies say their digital tools help ensure that patients\u2019 voices are heard when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable or can no longer speak for themselves.\nFor example, they can walk patients through their end-of-life prioritizes, enabling them to indicate that they most value being free from pain or not being a burden to their families. They also let patients specify the circumstances in which they\u2019d want life-sustaining treatment, like heart machines and dialysis.\nAnd their rise makes sense given the growth of the so-called \u201clongevity economy\u201d of services for the aging Baby Boomer demographic, increasing awareness among patients that they need to be more proactive about their health and the digitization of healthcare \u2014 not to mention major advances in medical technology.\nAs a study from the Pew Internet & American Life pointed out earlier this month, nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for another adult or child with a serious illness. And, a big chunk of those adults are part of the workforce. According to MyDirectives, caregiving-related expenses cost employers $17 to $33 billion a year in lost productivity (canceled meetings, delayed product launches, etc.) and an additional $11 billion in healthcare costs because caregivers suffer from stress, depression and other conditions.\nFor end-of-life care companies, that means there\u2019s an opportunity in targeting employers with a service that lets them improve care for their employees while hopefully contributing to productivity. For health plans, the pitch is that these services could help them attract and retain customers. And, in an era of rising healthcare costs, these services could also reduce the number of unwanted and often expensive procedures \u2013 an amount some experts peg at $6 billion a year.\nThat this topic isn\u2019t exactly uplifting is not lost on these companies \u2013 Jeff Zucker, co-founder and CEO of MyDirectives acknowledged that many people don\u2019t realize the ramifications of not having end-of-life documentation or just don\u2019t want to deal with it. But he said his hope is that his company, which started its work in 2007 and launched its service last year, can help people think of end-of-life planning as a way to take control of their circumstances, minimize suffering and honor a person\u2019s life.\nImage by racorn via Shutterstock.\nAnother great use of technology \u2013 I was not aware of these end of life apps/software but they seem like they would be incredibly useful (providing all health care providers would have easy access to them, of course!).\nI am the manager of HealthWorks Collective, the healthcare website in the Social Media Today network.

I would create a profile for you on our site and credit you as author, and would also link the post back to the original on gigacom. Please let me know if this is OK.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if there isn\u2019t a gray area that medical staff would consider intrusive or extreme and a family member would have considered it to be an option that may have extended the life of a loved one.\nDoes TrueNorth have an actual product available on the market right now?

{"idx": 476, "truncated_input": "In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It\u2019s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It\u2019s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme.\nYet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles. It\u2019s a brand that looks art directed by your 65-year-old parents who bought some no-name Android smartphone, hired based upon their portfolio of blurry photos on Facebook.\nIndeed, transparency strategy that\u2019s been working for Domino\u2019s since it started critiquing its own product in a 2010 reformulation and apology tour. Domino\u2019s admitted that its food was failing taste tests and disappointing consumers, and it promised to embrace more legible ingredients. Sales at Domino\u2019s continue to climb in the U.S. while industry-leader Pizza Hut\u2019s drop. One forecast projects Domino\u2019s taking Pizza Hut\u2019s No. 1 spot by the end of the year. And though it has fewer followers than the Hut, Domino\u2019s routinely gets more likes on Instagram and Twitter. In the world of big pizza, this unlikely approach is outmaneuvering the competition, including peers like Papa John\u2019s and Little Caesar\u2019s.\nBut let us be clear about something when it comes to Domino\u2019s social feeds. It\u2019s not just full of realistic photography without a food stylist on the set. It\u2019s often downright gross bro-food, like what you might see waking up at 5 a.m. on the floor of a frat house.\nWe\u2019re talking about grease-stained boxes, mozzarella cheese that has a white balance set to the color of earwax (17,000 likes).\nWe\u2019re talking about garlic knots that resemble lovingly shaped micro-penises (8,500 likes).\nHere\u2019s a twist you didn\u2019t see coming! Introducing BREAD TWISTS, pizza\u2019s newest best friend.\nWe\u2019re talking about congealed chicken wings sitting in a pool of lukewarm buffalo sauce (8,000 likes).\nWe\u2019re talking about using a flash to photograph food (10,000 likes).\nThis pizza\u2019s hot in more ways than one.????????????\nThe Domino\u2019s feed is not appetizing by any objective measure. But if you look at it long enough, over enough time, the cadence of grotesqueness begins to sink in. The studio lighting and Photoshop-enhanced pepperoni of Papa John\u2019s and Pizza Hut start to look like the culinary equivalent of a French manicure and a spray tan. Fake.\nInstead of employing professional photographers, Domino\u2019s relies on its digital marketing team to update the social media feeds. The cinema verit\u00e9 approach began in 2012, when Domino\u2019s launched the Show Us Your Pizza Campaign, and shared the (often ugly) food photos taken by its customers. After that, the aesthetic just stuck. And today, the pizzas Domino\u2019s photographs are all real, either pulled from a test kitchen oven, or delivered by an employee, no food stylist required. And, clearly, there\u2019s no sweating the need for natural light or perfect post-processing by Domino\u2019s employees who will sometimes even take photographs in their own suburban homes. Domino\u2019s is a living embodiment of a #nofilter brand.\nOf course, this approach doesn\u2019t just buck social media trends; it bucks everything established by fast food (or what the industry calls QSR) restaurants. Consider the low-angled Greek god stature with which McDonald\u2019s has photographed its Big Macs over the years. The bun is a golden mountain. The seeds upon it are alabaster gems. And somehow, as if through consumer X-ray vision, you can even make out the pickles, beef, lettuce, and special sauce within their perfectly balanced stack. These foods have always been photographed as icons, so carefully presented that no minimum wage employee working during the lunch rush could ever live up to the promise. And yet as consumers, we continue to fall for the bait and switch again and again.\nIn theory, Domino\u2019s will only drive more loyalty with every person who sees a deflated pile of cheese sticks on its feed and orders them in real life, because Domino\u2019s is delivering on its promise. And in the age of the unicorn-colored influencer, when nothing we see in social media is really all that real, perhaps society is using Domino\u2019s to self-administer its own antidote, one soggy slice at a time.\nFor now, Domino\u2019s plans to stay the course with its approach to food photography. Maloney suspects that Domino\u2019s will", "baseline_completion": " soon have competitors on Grosstagram, and as implausible as that may sound in today\u2019s influencer space, perhaps it\u2019s true.

{"idx": 478, "truncated_input": "The final chapter in Roy Andersson's droll trilogy 'on being a human being' introduces three dozen more brilliantly absurd vignettes.\nIn a Venice Film Festival lineup full of cynicism, suicide and despair, who would expect the new Roy Andersson picture \u2014 \u201cthe final part of a trilogy on being a human being\u201d \u2014 to be the most life-affirming? And yet, from its comic title to the wistful smile that accompanies its over-too-soon last shot, Andersson\u2019s delightfully odd \u201cA Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\u201d finds the Swedish master of comic absurdity feeling downright generous, perched at a comfortable enough distance from this coterie of sad sacks and lonelyhearts to recognize the humor in such painful subjects as mortality, aging, unpaid debts and unrequited love.\nJust last year, Ethan Hawke was quoted as referring to \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d and its two sequels as \u201cthe lowest-grossing trilogy in the history of motion pictures.\u201d But even he probably hasn\u2019t bought tickets to Andersson\u2019s incomparable triptych \u2014 rapturously received by critics, though audiences have proven all but allergic to the first two films, which have cleared barely $100,000 so far in the U.S. The result of four years of rigorous planning and meticulous execution, \u201cPigeon\u201d could fare slightly better than \u201cSongs From the Second Floor\u201d and \u201cYou, the Living\u201d (both of which bowed at Cannes), but only just. At least arthouse programmers can now get creative, treating Andersson\u2019s now-complete tragicomic opus, a decade and a half in the making, as the special event that it is.\n\u201cPigeon\u201d is by far the most accessible of the three films, offering a continuity throughline in the form of novelty salesmen Sam (Nils Westblom) and Jonathan (Holger Andersson), a comedic duo who\u2019d be right at home in a Samuel Beckett or Tom Stoppard play. Here, the Laurel-and-Hardy-esque pair appear in nearly one-third of the film\u2019s 37 fixed-camera compositions, a series of chuckle-inducing tableaux that clock in at just under three minutes apiece on average.\nEach of these shots serves as a nearly self-contained comic vignette, like a cross between a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d cartoon and a Gregory Crewdson photograph, and the best way to approach them is as you might a large-canvas painting or a Jacques Tati film: Study the faces, soak up the details, allow the eye to wander and the mind to free-associate. Where other directors seek out exceptional moments, Andersson endeavors to capture the poetry of the mundane.\nWith the exception of one scene, in which twin girls blow bubbles from the balcony of a nondescript apartment building, and another that observes a plumpish new mom (Andersson loves his ladies with a little meat on their bones) cooing over her baby carriage, all the characters here are adults. Most of them have fewer days ahead of them than they do behind, but none seem to truly appreciate the gift of living. Andersson does, and he wants us to recognize it, too.\nRight up front, the helmer presents three \u201cmeetings with death\u201d: a husband who suffers a heart attack while struggling to uncork a wine bottle; an old lady convinced she can take her handbag to heaven; and a cruise-ship passenger who collapses at the lunch counter, having just paid for his meal (sorry, no refunds). More playful than his fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, who famously challenged Death to a game of chess, Andersson recognizes that there\u2019s no cheating mortality \u2014 though sometimes we can speed it along, like the suicidal CEO glimpsed later in the film. Best just to have a sense of humor about it.\nSome critics have mistaken Andersson\u2019s movies as \u201cdepressing\u201d (while others have incorrectly labeled him a \u201ccommercials director,\u201d failing to understand that he accepted those commissions to finance his painstaking feature ventures). \u201cDroll\u201d would be a better word for the artist\u2019s attitude toward the washed-out blue and beige world he presents. His characters wear white face makeup to enhance their pallor, sleepwalking zombielike through their lives. Even the young couple seen necking on the beach appear to be doing so in slow-motion.\nIn the interval since his last film, Andersson has embraced hi-def digital cameras, which benefit his aesthetic enormously. Now, the helmer can ensure that even the far-distant background of every scene appears in sharp focus. Though the colors are dreary and the characters numb, compositionally speaking, there\u2019s not a single dull frame in the entire film. Andersson thinks like a painter, following Edward Hopper\u2019s example of enhancing loneliness by depicting it within a greater context. He shoots rooms at an angle, using perspective to direct our eyes toward the activity in adjacent rooms or on the other side of windows, instead of observing everything directly on axis, the way his similarly detail-oriented American namesake, Wes Anderson, insists on doing.\nIn \u201cPigeon,\u201d people go about their business in the dreary little boxes of their lives, but they don\u2019t behave like marionettes on strings, but almost like actors on a stage, occasionally turning to address the audience. \u201cToday I feel kind,\u201d announces a cheesemonger, while his wife gestures to the audience to let us know she thinks he\u2019s crazy.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the shift to digital has allowed Andersson to manipulate his footage the way directors such as David Fincher and Ruben Ostlund do, using their locked-down cameras to make invisible nips and tucks. Regardless of the method, the film is a master class in comic timing, employing pacing and repetition with the skill of a practiced concert pianist.\nEarly on, outside a dance studio where the flamenco teacher gets a little too hands-on with one of her pupils, a lady janitor says into her phone, \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d (Mobile phones are a rare nod to modern life in a film that appears to be set in a timeless retro past \u2014 and where King Charles XII and his infantry are prone to drop in unannounced, like characters in a Monty Python sketch.) The cleaning woman\u2019s line becomes a hollow platitude echoed by many of the characters by film\u2019s end, and yet, there\u2019s something to be said for merely surviving in such an absurd world as this.\nDown on their luck, Sam and Jonathan bill themselves as being in the \u201centertainment business,\u201d selling plastic vampire teeth and a corny laughing device engineered to amuse. These two friends look like they haven\u2019t smiled in a long, long time. Emerging as the most well-rounded character in the entire trilogy, Jonathan suffers from melancholy spells, culminating in a disturbing dream sequence, where colonial soldiers lead African slaves into a giant copper instrument that produces a beautiful sound as the people inside are being roasted alive. What a curious species are homo sapiens. Judging by the film, we wage war, torture animals and take advantage of one another, and yet, Andersson assures us, things could be worse. In the grand scheme of things, he\u2019s happy to show we\u2019re doing fine.\nProduction: (Sweden-Norway-France-Germany) A Roy Andersson Filmproduktion production, in co-production with 4 1/2 Fiksjon, Essentail Filmproduction, Parisienne de Production, Sveriges Television, Arte France Cinema, ZDF/Arte, with support from Svenska Filminstitutet, Eurimages Council of Europe, Nordisk Film- och TV Fond, Norska Filmfonden, Film- ind Medienstiftung NRW, CNC.

The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car.

They received a $4,000 grant that helped them pay travel expenses to the Philippines to bring the children home.\nThough they had always had tossed around the idea of adoption, they were spurred to take action when their older son asked them about it a few years ago.\n\"He said, 'Hey. Can we adopt? I'd like to have a brother,\" Misty Mapes recalled.\nMisty Mapes, who works as a teacher, and Patrick, who is a dockworker, set about eliminating as many of their expenses as they could to save the $40,000 they would need to took to fund the adoption.\nThat final boost was provided by the Gift of Adoption Fund, which bridges the game when people are nearing the goal of completing the adoption, but need a little extra financial help to finalize it, said Marcy McKay, a La Grange resident and volunteer for the fund.\nThough they didn't need the financial help to adopt their children that the Gift of Adoption Fund provides, the McKays, who have three adopted children ages 14, 13, and 11, know how costly it is and are working to help other families adopt.\nIn November 2014, Bethany and Jared Crain got a call saying that they were matched with an expectant mother.\nWhile they were ecstatic that they could be adding to their family of three, they decided not to tell their 4-year-old that she could be getting a sibling.\n\"It's just so extremely expensive,\" said McKay. \"A lot of people don't have that kind of money.\"\nThe need on the part of children to have families is great, too. The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family. Those children may be siblings, like Regina and Regino Mapes, children who are aging out, have medical needs or who may go into foster care.\nThe grants that are supplied by the nonprofit range from $3,500 to $7,500.\nJoan Schoon's desire to be a foster parent was born out of compassion and sympathy.\nAs a teenager, she remembers listening to her friends who were foster children complain about treatment they endured in some of their previous foster homes.\n\"They apply for the exact dollar amount they need and the grants are paid directly to the adoption agency,\" McKay said.\nThe fund was founded in 1996", "baseline_completion": " by a couple who, like the McKays, felt thankful that they had the financial resources to pay for adopting children, and wanted to help other families who need the support, according to its website.\nShe said the group raises money through a variety of fundraisers such as cocktail parties and golf outings.\n\"It's such a compelling cause,\" said McKay, noting that many of their donations are in the $50 to $100 ranges.\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she said.", "orig_sample_length": 851, "prompt_length": 751, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": " by the late Dr. John M.

She can automate any process in a business,\" he added.\nAmelia can be pre-trained to handle requests and questions related to HR, finance, IT and procurement. In fact, according to Dube, Amelia can be trained to handle almost any knowledge-based task.\n\"She helps customers open new bank accounts, process insurance claims and register patients for hospital entry. As a whisper agent, Amelia provides her human colleagues with a personalised conversational user interface (UI),\" said Dube, who thinks Amelia can do wonders in transforming India's healthcare sector.\n\"Amelia allows patients to self-manage in scheduling doctors' appointments, tests and medicines. She can also offer condition-specific advice and well-curated health management tips.\n\"A robust digital colleague like Amelia can free caregivers from high-volume patient needs to provide specialised care for unique or pressing concerns, while subsequently providing patients with enhanced 24/7 access to medical services,\" Dube explained.\n\"AI and Amelia are vital for an inclusive and democratic healthcare sector and could have an enormous impact,\" he added.\nAccording to him, common AI assistants like Alexa, Cortana and Siri cannot read between the lines. They cannot understand underlying meanings or emotional expressions. Even when it comes to more advanced AI, the majority of these virtual assistants lack capabilities of contextualising information as people do, he said.\n\"When customers or employees interact with Amelia, they don't feel they are interacting with something artificial due to her advanced empathetic abilities, capacity to switch context and channels, and intelligent responses. Amelia is the only AI on the market that offers all of these features with expert-level accuracy and emotional intelligence,\" Dube noted.\nIPsoft, Dube said, is now exploring opportunities with a number of agencies in digital health programmes, to accelerate technology adoption which will take pressure off of the human workforce while maintaining and improving services.\nThe company, which has 16 offices in 13 countries, including one in Bengaluru, helps with the digitisation process required in an organisation to deploy Amelia and make her work.\n\"It is a crucial part of our work to make sure our clients have the right prerequisites to implement Amelia.

The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut Measure 97 opponents also pointed to a written opinion from a lawyer for the Legislature that said lawmakers could spend the revenue as they wanted simply by passing budget bills, despite language in the measure calling for the money to be spent on early childhood and K-12 education, health care", "baseline_completion": " and services for seniors.\nGov.

Sample addressed to \"Members of the Trojan Family,\" and in it he said he \"sharply\" disagreed \"with many of the conclusions reached by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.\"\nAmong those conclusions was that USC knew or should have known that star running back Reggie Bush and members of his family were receiving extra benefits from would-be marketers and prospective sports agents in violation of NCAA rules.

Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them.\nThe Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet.\nAfter meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf.\nDelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind.\nMonday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff.\nSpeaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would \"abide by any decision the family makes.\"\n\"After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley,\" Allred said.\nEarlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday.\n\"Our contract is still in full bloom,\" Cynthia Bradley said. \"We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers.

Although the decision wasn't widely reported around the world, here in Dubai, the city went crazy.\nThe announcement was made late evening our time, and within minutes, the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, was lit up by fireworks. Shortly after that, the ruler, Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al-Matktoum, announced that all schools were to be given the day off in celebration.\nThe last-minute decision created a flurry of activity, as schools desperately tried to contact parents letting them know; messages flew around on email and text from schools, but in reality, the children were way ahead of the adults, and already contacting their mates with the news over BBM, text, and Skype.\nSo what does this mean for Dubai and the UAE? Well, the emirate will spend $7bn on the direct infrastructure it needs for Expo 2020 and it is likely to create around 277,000 jobs between now and 2021, when the six-month exhibition finishes.\nIt means more people coming here to live and work, more visas being processed, more companies bidding for work or supplying services and as this business activity increases, quietly in the background, it means data. Lots of data. Data on spending, on new residents, on schemes to prepare for the Expo, on the utility needs this sudden growth creates and so on.\nFor the IT industry, the surge in the data that companies want to analyse means more demand for software, hardware and services.\nDubai and the wider UAE recovered pretty quickly from the economic downturn. It kept spending on big infrastructure schemes and benefited economically from some of the tragedy happening elsewhere in the Arab world, as people fled conflict to set up home here. So, in big data terms, technology companies were already highlighting the UAE as among the fastest growing in the region.\nExpats, for instance, have to send their children to private schools over here, as state schools are open only to locals. The emirate's Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which oversees education, says there are 153 private schools in Dubai, educating more than 225,000 students across 15 curricula (such as the English, American or Indian national curriculum).\nPrivate schools cater to almost 89 percent of Dubai's population and due to their reputation, around 43 percent of local students also attend private schools.\nSo, as the emirate's companies employ more people, you can guarantee that those who run the private schools are crunching the numbers as they try and estimate how many extra places will be needed over the next seven years, in which curricula they are likely to enrol and seeking trends in educational practices that can be adopted as they accommodate the rising student population. And so it will be for every other industry.\nAnalyst firm IDC recently predicted before the win that investment in business analytics in the Middle East is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 percent over the next five years. Just over 40 percent of CIOs in the Middle East, it said, are considering investments in analytics and big data technologies.\nThe UAE, it added, \"has been at the forefront of business analytics and big data adoption across the Middle East\".\nThe company said 58 percent of CIOs cited governance, regulation and compliance requirements, transparency, and reporting as key reasons for investing in big data and analytics technologies.\nEMC research also points to growing awareness of data analytics in the UAE. Its survey among 237 IT decision makers in the country found that 87 percent of respondents thought decision making within their company could be improved through better use of data, with 67 percent saying that senior managers trust the insights such analysis provides when making important business decisions.\nFurther, 45 percent felt they had gained a competitive edge over a rival through big data analytics, with 67 percent stating that organisations that use such tools will be the ones that succeed. However, 27 percent of those surveyed said they have no plans to use big data technology and 57 percent said the lack of a clear business case or proven return on investment was the most common reason for not adopting it.\nSo, while a quarter of companies are yet to be convinced, big data has the attention of the region's IT heads. It is more a case of coming, rather than arrived, but is still good news for all those involved in the industry. Third-party data centres for instance, are still an emerging industry in the Middle East, albeit now in the latter stages (and in the UAE, established).\nUAE neighbour Saudi Arabia, for instance, is also investing heavily. It has some pretty strict rules about where data can be held and as the region's engine of growth, datacentres could become big business. IDC reports that by the end of this year, the kingdom's IT spending will have reached $1.09bn, up 15.1 percent on 2012. Much of that is going into datacentres and IT as a service business models.\nSo a growing economy is positive for future business, but it is likely to quickly uncover the fact that while data sets grow, the skills to analyse it, at least initially, won't keep pace. Big data analytics isn't all about the technology; it requires the human touch too. It is humans that set up the analysis and humans that through cognition, interpret the data.\nWhile the regional big data industry is firmly fledgling at the moment, it is expected to see high percentage growth in the next few years. And that also means a period of opportunity for the analysts, particularly those who can quickly adapt their skills.\nThere is, I think, a measure of overconfidence around", "baseline_completion": " big data in the region, highlighted to a degree by the EMC's survey, where 79 percent of UAE-based respondents said their company had the right skills and knowledge to complete business priorities successfully and an equal number said it would be a challenge for skills to keep pace with IT innovation over the next three years.\nBut expect Dubai and the wider UAE, and in its wake the richer industrialised countries, to be able to attract the people who can take big data and turn it into intelligence.", "orig_sample_length": 1284, "prompt_length": 1184, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": " the UAE's ability to handle the data that will be generated by Expo 2020.

{"idx": 509, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies involved in U.S. construction plan on intensifying their involvement in green building over the next three years, according to the new World Green Building Trends Study from Dodge Data & Analytics, conducted with support from United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) and its UTC Climate, Controls & Security business. The U.S. is also one of the global leaders in the percentage of firms expecting to construct new green institutional projects and green retrofits of existing buildings.\nThe global study, which received additional support from Saint-Gobain, the U.S. Green Building Council and the Regenerative Network, positions the U.S. as a strong participant in the global green movement. Responses from more than 1,000 building professionals from 60 countries place the U.S. green industry in context. The study also provides specific comparisons with 12 other countries from which a sufficient response was gained to allow for statistical analysis: Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nAccording to the report, U.S. construction should see an increase in the share of green work in the next few years, largely as a result of companies intensifying their involvement in the green building industry. An increasing percentage of respondents projected that more than 60 percent of their projects would be green projects - from 24 percent of respondents in 2015 to 39 percent in 2018. Respondents projecting that fewer than 15 percent of their projects would be certified green plummeted from 41 percent in 2015 to 27 percent by 2018.\nWhile this increased share of green building is impressive, it is significantly less than many developing countries included in the survey. For example, Brazil expects six-fold growth (from 6 percent to 36 percent) in the percentage of companies conducting a majority of their projects green; five-fold growth is expected in China (from 5 percent to 28 percent); and four-fold growth is expected in Saudi Arabia (from 8 percent to 32 percent).\n\"The strong U.S. industry for green building projects is clearly an opportunity for U.S. firms, but so is the rapid rise of green in many of the developing countries,\" said Stephen Jones, Senior Director of Industry Insights, Dodge Data & Analytics. \"Expertise from experienced green designers, builders and manufacturers from the U.S. is likely to be essential to support the aggressive green building expectations revealed by the study respondents.\"\nIn the U.S., the highest percentage of respondents report that they expect to work on new green institutional projects (such as schools, hospitals and public buildings), green retrofits of existing buildings and new green commercial construction (such as office and retail buildings) in the next three years. When compared with global averages, it becomes clear that the U.S. is a leader in new green institutional construction and green retrofits of existing buildings.\n43 percent of U.S. respondents plan to work on green retrofits of existing buildings, again well above the global average of 37 percent.\nThe U.S. is also distinguished from the global findings in terms of the importance it places on reducing energy consumption as an environmental reason for building green. Over three quarters (76 percent) of U.S. respondents consider this important, nearly double the percentage of the next most important environmental factor, which is reducing water consumption. While the other 12 countries in the study prioritize the reduction of energy consumption, only Germany, Poland and Singapore do so to the same extent.\n\"The survey shows that global green building activity continues to double every three years,\" said United Technologies Chief Sustainability Officer John Mandyck. \"More people recognize the economic and productivity value that green buildings bring to property owners and tenants, along with the energy and water benefits to the environment, which is driving the green building industry's growth. It's a win-win for people, planet and the economy.\"\nThe study demonstrates the benefits of building green, with median operating cost decreases for green buildings of 9 percent expected in just one year globally. Building owners also report seeing a median increase of 7 percent in the value of their green buildings compared to traditional buildings, an increase that is consistent between newly built green buildings and those that are renovated green. These business benefits are a critical driver for the growth of green building anticipated globally.\nThe U.S. is also notable for having the lowest percentage of respondents who report that their company uses metrics to track green building performance. Only 57 percent of U.S. respondents report using metrics, compared to a 75 percent average globally. This may be linked to the fact that the U.S. is also the country with the highest level of concern reported about higher perceived first costs for green building, notably more than the percentage who consider this an important challenge to green in other developed countries with active construction markets like Germany and the U.K.\nDodge Data & Analytics is the leading provider of data, analytics, news and intelligence serving the North American construction industry.

Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case. The final dimensions of the prototype were 2\" x 2\" x 5\"(Height x Width x Length). A series of prototypes were constructed with different design options.

This year I feel I am at the end of my rope. The first day of classes for my oldest daughter just didn\u2019t happen. She and her professors took part in demonstrations instead of lectures.

Now, with budget cuts, they are reducing the staff. That, to me, seemed incredible.\nLast week, however, the crisis really hit home. My youngest daughter has been sick with a cold. She was at swim practice and was having trouble breathing. She spoke to her coach and he advised her to leave practice and go directly to the student health office.

{"idx": 517, "truncated_input": "A common misconception about my profession is that we spend a lot of our time devising fancy avoidance schemes usually involving exotic offshore destinations. I\u2019m afraid that for firms like ours the reality is much more mundane \u2013 think Canvey Island rather than the Cayman Islands.\nThe majority of what we do is quite routine compliance work such as tax returns. But this is interspersed with some more interesting stuff, including planning, company reorganisation and acquisitions. I love this advisory work, not just because it\u2019s the most profitable but also because it is intellectually challenging. Like most of us in tax, I\u2019m a bit of a nerd.\nThere is a lot of nonsense talked about tax. Contrary to popular belief most rich people don\u2019t avoid tax: they pay lots of it. It is very difficult for a UK resident and domiciled individual to legally avoid tax \u2013 most of the \u201ctax gap\u201d is caused by multinational companies, and to tackle that needs international cooperation.\nI\u2019ve found most people take a realistic approach to paying tax \u2013 they may grumble about it but in the end they\u2019ll pay it. There are a few people who try to avoid paying any tax if they can, almost as a matter of principle. But they make nightmare clients, and I won\u2019t deal with them.\nObviously a hot topic is where legitimate tax planning ends and unacceptable avoidance starts. My own view is that once you start introducing artificial transactions with no commercial purpose then you\u2019re in danger of crossing the line from planning to avoidance.\nI have never advocated \u201cpackaged\u201d avoidance schemes to my clients, and in fact have actively discouraged people from using them. This is on practical as well as moral grounds \u2013 most just don\u2019t work, as evidenced by HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) current 80% success rate when challenging them at tribunals.\nNot many people appreciate that George Osborne probably did more to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion than any other chancellor. His accelerated payment notice regime has basically killed off promoted schemes. Anyone who uses one these days is either very brave or very stupid.\nThere has been a lot of fuss recently over the fact that HMRC\u2019s high-net-worth unit has apparently prosecuted only one person in the past five years. This doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. If HMRC\u2019s aim is to recover as much tax as possible in the shortest time, it makes sense to pursue a civil settlement \u2013 they get the tax plus interest and penalties (up to 100%) for comparatively little effort on their part. If they prosecute it can take years, costing millions, and there is no guarantee of a conviction at the end of it. The burden of proof in a criminal case is high and it can be difficult to prove intent.\nI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do when I graduated at the end of the 70s and drifted into accountancy almost by accident. I qualified as a chartered accountant in the early 80s and spent the first few years in audit before moving to more general practice work. I found I was doing more and more tax work and enjoying it, so I took the exams and qualified as a chartered tax adviser.\nI\u2019m a partner in a small suburban practice. There are 20 of us in total and it\u2019s a really nice place to work. I think so anyway, and most of our staff seem to agree, as very few people leave. We pay well and offer flexible working, which is very popular as many of our employees have caring responsibilities.\nI do fairly normal office hours, although sometimes I\u2019ll work late or over the weekend if there is a particularly tight deadline. My hourly rate is \u00a3200 to \u00a3300, depending upon the complexity of the work, and I earn a decent, six-figure income. That\u2019s much less than partners in large firms earn, but I don\u2019t think I could cope with the pressure they are under.\nMuch of my time is spent making sure that our clients don\u2019t fall foul of what are sometimes very complex rules when carrying out normal commercial transactions. For instance, at the moment I\u2019m working on a demerger, splitting a family business between two warring factions. There are reliefs available to enable this to happen without a huge tax bill but there are strict conditions too, and my job is to make sure they are all met.\nOur client base is varied: mainly family businesses and their owners, plus some reasonably wealthy individuals but also quite a few high-net-worth individuals \u2013 people with a total wealth of at least \u00a310m and in most cases considerably more.\nSome people have very complex affairs, and to handle them properly you need to know a lot about them, including some very personal things. I think I know more about some of my clients\u2019 personal affairs than their own partners do. Confidentiality is absolutely critical. They have to trust me, and that\u2019s why a good rapport with the client is essential. I get on very well with most of them, and some have become personal friends. If you don\u2019t get on, then the relationship doesn\u2019t usually last very long.\nThe clients who really annoy me are those who take decisions, sometimes involving significant sums of money, based on what they read in the newspaper or what their pals at the golf club have told them, without taking heed of professional advice. Usually it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to pay for an hour of my time. A frequent mistake is to give an asset away to save on inheritance tax without realising there\u2019s a possible capital gains tax liability.\nOn the whole I like my job, but there are a number of frustrations. Dealing with HMRC can be a nightmare owing to cutbacks and constant reorganisations. A lot of their senior staff have left and been replaced with more junior people, sometimes barely above the level of call centre operatives. Then there\u2019s keeping up to date with the torrent of new legislation appearing every year. Despite being a tax geek, I struggle.

{"idx": 520, "truncated_input": "In 1987, Blessed John Paul II wrote his encyclical letter entitled \"Mother of the Redeemer: On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Life of the Pilgrim Church.\" It contains a wonderful summary of the teaching of the Church on the meaning, mystery and gift of Mary in the Plan of Salvation. It proceeds through the Scripture, the Sacred Tradition, the Church Councils, and the Magisterial teachings of the Church. The Holy father wrote: \"With good reason, then, at the end of this Millennium, we Christians who know that the providential plan of the Most Holy Trinity is the central reality of Revelation and of faith feel the need to emphasize the unique presence of the Mother of Christ in history, especially during these last years leading up to the year 2000.\n\"The Second Vatican Council prepares us for this by presenting in its teaching the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and of the Church. If it is true, as the Council itself proclaims, that 'only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light,' then this principle must be applied in a very particular way to that exceptional \"daughter of the human race,\" that extraordinary \"woman\" who became the Mother of Christ. Only in the mystery of Christ is her mystery fully made clear. Thus has the Church sought to interpret it from the very beginning: the mystery of the Incarnation has enabled her to penetrate and to make ever clearer the mystery of the Mother of the Incarnate Word.\n\"The Council of Ephesus (431 AD) was of decisive importance in clarifying this, for during that Council, to the great joy of Christians, the truth of the divine motherhood of Mary was solemnly confirmed as a truth of the Church's faith.\nMary is the Mother of God (= Theot\u0102\u0142kos), since by the power of the Holy Spirit she conceived in her virginal womb and brought into the world Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is of one being with the Father. \"The Son of God...born of the Virgin Mary...has truly been made one of us,\" has been made man.\n\"Thus, through the mystery of Christ, on the horizon of the Church's faith there shines in its fullness the mystery of his Mother. In turn, the dogma of the divine motherhood of Mary was for the Council of Ephesus and is for the Church like a seal upon the dogma of the Incarnation, in which the Word truly assumes human nature into the unity of his person, without cancelling out that nature.\"\nThe first four ecumenical Councils of the Church confirmed and defined Christian belief about the nature of God and the meaning of the Incarnation, saving life, death, ascension and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Council pronouncements concerning Mary were made in reference to defending the truths about Jesus Christ and God's plan of salvation for the entire human race. That plan included, and still includes, the Mother of God.\nThe Catechism, in keeping with the unbroken tradition of the Church, makes the inseparable connection or link between the humanity of Jesus and the humanity of his Mother, as did Blessed John Paul in his encyclical letter cited above. The first four Councils of the Church, which are almost universally accepted among the broader Christian community even beyond the full communion of the Catholic Church, did the same. St. Gregory the Great (540-604 AD) once affirmed \"I confess that I accept and reverence the four Councils as I do the four Gospels...for they are founded on universal consent.\"\nThe Councils affirmed the core of the Christian claim about who Jesus is and thus, who we can become in Him. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD contended with a priest of Alexandria named Arius who taught that the Word or Son of God (who \"became flesh and dwelt among us\" as Jesus - Jn 1:14) was not God. Misusing passages in John's Gospel (14:28) where Jesus proclaimed \"the Father is greater than I\" Arius denied that the Word of God, was eternal. The bishops at Nicaea considered all the texts of the Gospels (such as Jn 10:30: \"I and the Father are one\") under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and declared that Arius was in error. The Son or Word of God is God (see Jn 1:1) and always existed. This was memorialized in the Nicene Creed. They used a Greek word homoousios, which meant that the Word or Son is of the same \"being\" as God the Father. If the Father is God, so is the Son.\nThe struggle continued for fifty more years before the First Council of Constantinople (381 AD) reaffirmed the creed of Nicaea. This ecumenical council also felt it necessary to affirm the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the \"Lord and Giver of Life\" who with the Father and the Son \"is worshipped and glorified\" and that phrase was added to the Nicene Creed. In the fifth century there were two more councils that addressed questions about Jesus. In the early 5th century a prominent bishop, Nestorius, rejected the title \"theotokos\" or \"God-bearer\" as a proper term for Mary.\nChristians had always affirmed that the mother of Jesus could rightly be called the \"Mother of God\" or \"God-bearer\" because the Gospels teach that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary. Mary's consent, her \"Fiat\" to the message of the Angel Gabriel (see Lk 1:26-38) was an essential element of the faith of the early Church, a model for all Christians. She was viewed as the \"Second Eve\" whose \"Yes\" untied the knot caused by Eve's \"No\".\nA Bishop named Nestorius objected to the title of Theotokos, Mother of God or God Bearer for Mary. The Council of Ephesus met in 431AD and affirmed Mary was the \"Mother of God\" because she is the mother of God in his human nature which, because of the Incarnation, could not be separated from the divine nature. The Council also affirmed that Mary's exercise of her human freedom, her assent, was a significant part of the plan of salvation, giving to the Incarnate Word, Jesus, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, his true and full humanity. When God the Holy Spirit \"overshadowed\" Mary the child born to her was truly God, the Son or Word of God (Lk 1:30-35).\nAfter this Council, a monk, Eutyches claimed that before Jesus took flesh in Mary but that there were two \"natures\" - a divine and a human nature. After the union of the two natures in Mary's womb, only one nature was left in Jesus - the divine nature. Eutyches essentially proposed that the divine nature swallowed up the humanity of Jesus. So Jesus only took on human appearance. The Cappadocian father, Gregory of Nazianzus, once proclaimed \"whatever was not assumed was not healed\". In that we understand the danger of the denial of the sacred humanity of Jesus. Redemption would not be complete.\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD dealt with this threat to the meaning and implications of the Incarnation of the Word of God. The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which", "baseline_completion": " are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human.

{"idx": 523, "truncated_input": "Learning How to Love My Kids, Again (or why I'm thankful for Veteran's day even though it means another day off of school) | Thin Places | A blog by Amy Julia Becker on Faith, Family, and Disability.\nOur day started at 5:50, with William by my bedside. \"Mommy, the only thing that will make me happy is if you give me a movie right now.\"\nI squeezed my eyes shut. \"William, is it six o'clock yet?\"\n\"No. It was taking too long.\"\nWilliam knows two things: he is supposed to stay in his bed until 6:00, and he only gets to watch something on weekend mornings.\n\"William, you can go back to your bed for ten minutes and then I will come up, or you can go start an art project by yourself.\"\n\"But Mommy! The only thing that will make me happy is a movie right now!\"\nI've been attending a parenting class based upon Positive Discipline. The premise is that discipline doesn't need to be punishment, and that acting positive doesn't mean giving permission to do everything. It involves lots of \"strategies\" and \"solutions\" to problems. The adult retains authority, but not because of an assertion of power and control but because of firm but loving guidance for the child. I completely agree with this approach from a theoretical and spiritual perspective. I understand God as a Father who gives us \"rules\" out of love and care for us, not out of a desire to dominate our lives, a Father who is \"for\" us and wants our best. I see myself as a parent who wants to provide a lot of structure for our children, which includes rules and expectations, coupled with a lot of love.\nSo Positive Discipline seems right up my alley. And in the classroom of adults-pretending-to-be-children, it works really well. This past Monday, we solved the problem of one kid terrorizing a cat and another (mine) drawing with milk all over the table.\nIt hasn't worked out quite as well in our home. Last week (on Monday, three hours after class, as it happens) William and I played a Busytown game. At the end of the game, I was feeling very proud of myself for sharing \"special time\" with my son and crawling around on the floor searching for ladders and clocks and all the other objects on the game's board.\nWilliam was not feeling that same pride. He started throwing the pieces all over the room. I put on my Positive Discipline hat and considered the logical consequences of his actions. I told him if he treated the game like garbage, I would put it in the garbage. I gave him the chance to go to his room to calm down, and then decide. Ten minutes later, he looked me straight in the eye (with his pacifier, giraffe, and blanket, just in case I'm tempted to forget that he's four when we fight with each other and he wins, which is what seems to happen most days), and said, \"Throw it away.\"\nI made a big fuss of putting the whole game in a garbage bag and taking it to the trash bins outside. I then realized that a) I had cleaned up the entire game while William lounged in his bed and b) I was about to throw away a perfectly good game. So it is currently stored in the trunk of our car, and I am still trying to figure out how I should have handled that one differently.\nBut back to this morning.\n\"William, you know that we've agreed that we don't watch movies in the morning.\"\nHe starts pounding the bed. Hard. Over and over and over. In the dark.\nLet's just say it did not end well, and I found myself longing for a different model of parenting, one in which the parents asserted control and the kids just listened and did what they were told and there was none of this unbelievably time-consuming, emotionally-draining, hard hard hard work of figuring out how to love the kid and listen to the kid and be firm and clear, and all before the sun comes up.\nAnd of course, it's Veteran's Day. So we have yet another week with a day (or two or three, as has happened a lot recently) off from school. (We haven't had a full week of school since the first week of October.) And this day has begun, in the dark, in tears.\nI was ready to write a post today about why schools should stay open for national holidays. Close the banks. Close the post office. But keep the schools open and teach the kids about what or whomever deserves commemoration rather than offering yet one more disruptive three-day weekend. I stand by my guns on this one (yet another issue that would garner all the Mom votes in the next election), but it turns out I'm grateful that today was a day with no place to go and time on our hands as a family.\nAnd it was kind of fun. For all of us. William and Penny took turns using the scissors and got excited when they found great pictures to accompany our different items and hanging up a gigantic piece of paper on the wall of the playroom is hugely exciting.

Southern California has always been an arid land, with cycles of drought, interspersed with wet years every now and again.\nIn December of 1915, San Diego\u2019s city fathers tackled the issue from a completely different angle. They hired a rainmaker!\nThe impetus for their decision was the unfilled Morena Reservoir in the mountains sixty miles east of San Diego. A rock-filled dam had been completed in 1912, but the reservoir had yet to be filled beyond a third of its capacity. Other reservoirs in the area shared the same problem. None were filled and the city was growing.\nThe Council voted 4 to 1 in favor of Hatfield, though a formal agreement was never drawn up.\nOn January 1, 1916, Charles and his brother, Joel, set up a tower beside Morena Reservoir and began work which they labeled as \u201cmoisture enhancement.\u201d Using secret formulas that Charles never disclosed, he mixed and released various chemicals into the air. Four days later, he reported rain at Morena.\nOn January 10th rain fell heavily for twenty-four hours, ceased for a couple of days, then fell in torrents from January 14th to 18th. The San Diego River overflowed, flooding Old Town and Mission Valley. Roads, railroads and bridges were swept away. From Balboa Park, water streamed down the hill into downtown streets. At one point, four feet of water rushed down Broadway.\nBy January 27th the deluge reached epic proportions. In the South Bay area, the water level in the Sweetwater reservoir rose until it overflowed the dam, tearing out a fifty-foot chunk on one end. The Bonita valley became a swirling mass of muddy water taking out farms, houses, roads, railroads and telegraph lines.\nThe Sweetwater Dam had been a tourist attraction. First built in 1888, it was raised and retrofitted a few times, until by 1915, it was the highest dam in the United States. A rail line brought sightseers to this concrete engineering wonder.\nA little farther South, the water level in Otay Reservoir crept closer and closer to the top of the dam. Construction on the Otay Reservoir dam had begun in 1888 spearheaded by Elisha S. Babcock who built the Hotel del Coronado. As early as 1897, James D. Schuyler, the engineer who had designed the Sweetwater Dam, warned that the rock-filled Lower Otay Dam might not survive a severe storm. His prophecy came true.\nNo one knows for sure how many lives were lost in the Flood of 1916. Some say twenty; others, sixty. Many of the victims were Japanese farmers who lived in the valleys. In the days following the disaster, several Japanese people could be seen in boats searching the South Bay for lost loved ones. A monument to the Japanese victims of the flood can be seen in Mount Hope Cemetery.\nThe entire San Diego area was isolated from the world, highways and railroads washed away, telephone lines destroyed. The only way in and out of Chula Vista was by boat from the yacht club dock at the end of F Street.\nOut near Otay Lakes is a road named after the dam\u2019s first caretaker, Wueste Road; and in the campground at Morena Lake a plaque has been erected describing Mr. Hatfield\u2019s rainmaking work in January 1916.\nCarrie, a school teacher, does her best to discourage Nate\u2019s interest in her.

Yet only 10 were reported to the college, which regulates Ontario nurses, when Wettlaufer was fired in March 2014 from the Caressant Care home in Woodstock.\nBy then, Wettlaufer had already killed seven residents in her care and assaulted two others with overdoses of insulin.

She continued to work, with an unblemished public record on the College of Nurses website, until she turned herself in.\nSandler suggested the college didn\u2019t investigate Wettlaufer in 2014 because the termination report to the regulatory body didn\u2019t provide a full picture of Wettlaufer\u2019s history. \u201cIt could leave a misleading impression\u201d if a nurse\u2019s full disciplinary history and medication errors isn\u2019t reported to the college, Sandler said.\nHelen Crombez, former director of nursing at Caressant, replied that administrators at the nursing home believed the 10 items noted in the termination report to the college would have been enough to spark an investigation on whether Wettlaufer was fit to continue practising.

{"idx": 530, "truncated_input": "Does a Pyrethrin-Based Spray Kill Gnats?\nPyrethrins rapidly decompose after exposure to light and air.\nFungus gnats are tiny insects that can quickly become a huge nuisance in outdoor areas during stretches of cool, wet weather. Harmless to people, pets and landscaping plants, adult gnat populations quickly get out of control because each female can lay up to 300 eggs, with each egg hatching in about three days. Pyrethrin-based insecticidal sprays can help you control extreme gnat infestations, but you must start treatment as soon as you notice the pests.\nPyrethrins are natural, botanical pesticides derived from the flowers of certain chrysanthemums. The blooms are harvested and typically dried or ground into powder. Adult fungus gnats are highly susceptible to pyrethrins, which work as a contact poison that rapidly penetrates the insect's nervous system so it can't fly or move around. Although gnats drop almost immediately after you spray them, they don't always die. Gnats, like other insects, possess an enzyme that quickly detoxifies the pyrethrins, which allows some gnats to recover after initially being knocked down. Because of this, many pyrethrin-based products also contain a petroleum-derived synergist or carbamate to slow down that enzyme's action. Many pyrethrin products come in ready-to-spray formulations that make outdoor treatment easy.\nPyrethrin-based sprays quickly reduce fungus gnat populations, but control is typically temporary. New adult gnats emerge every day, so be prepared to spray affected plants about every three days for at least 14 days to get rid of the pests. After reading the instructions on the product's label, attach a container of ready-to-spray, pyrethrin-based insecticide to a garden hose. Once you turn on the water, it automatically mixes with the chemicals to form the correct application dosage. Hold the container 18 to 24 inches away from the target plant and thoroughly spray the tops and undersides of the leaves. Spray the surface of the soil around gnat-infested plants as well. Allow the solution to completely dry before reentering the treated area. For optimal control results, use a pyrethrin spray only when rain isn't predicted for your area for at least 24 hours.\nPyrethrin can cause itching, irritation or a burning sensation if it makes contact with skin, so reduce your risk of exposure by wearing protective clothing, including long sleeves, pants, socks and shoes, a face mask, goggles and rubber or latex gloves. Start spraying for gnats at the farthest corner of your target treatment area and work your way backward to avoid walking through sprayed areas. Spray pyrethrin products when the air is calm to avoid drift. Pyrethrin is highly toxic to honey bees, so spray plants just before sunup or at twilight to avoid harming the pollinating insects.\nMature fungus gnats range in size from 1/15 to 1/2 inch long and have clear to pale gray wings. Although nuisances, they consume only liquids such as flower nectar and water. Fungus gnats are pretty weak fliers that prefer sticking close to their host plants. The legless larvae have clear to white bodies and black heads.

{"idx": 531, "truncated_input": "The messaging upstart's track record shows why its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses shouldn't be taken lightly, even if big questions remain.\nSnapchat -- or Snap Inc., as it now calls itself -- has become a $20 billion company in the face of constant doubting from consumers and pundits who looked at its messaging app, shook their heads and said something to the effect of \"I don't get it\" or \"This is a gimmick.\"\nThat's worth keeping in mind when reacting to its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses.\nSpectacles, unveiled on Friday evening in a Wall Street Journal column, costs $130, comes in three colors and lets users record up to 10 seconds of video by tapping a button on the glasses. The video is recorded in circular, rather than rectangular, form and is taken by a lens with a relatively wide 115-degree field-of-view.\nAs one would expect, Spectacles uses wireless links to pair with smartphones. Snap founder and CEO Evan Spiegel is trying to downplay near-term expectations for the glasses, referring to them as a toy and promising to take a slow approach to commercializing them. \"It's about us figuring out if it fits into people's lives and seeing how they like it,\" he says.\nStill, it's worth remembering the Snapchat app itself was dismissed as a gimmick -- nothing more than a way for teenagers to share pictures they didn't want their parents to see, and which wouldn't be permanently stored -- not too long ago. The same has held for subsequent features such as the ability to draw and write text on top of shared pictures, the ability to create \"Stories\" whose content vanishes after 24 hours and the ability to add face-altering \"lenses\" to photos and videos.\nIn spite of the frequent derision, Snapchat has grown to have more than 150 million users (more than Twitter (TWTR - Get Report) ), a large portion of whom are in their 20s and 30s rather than just teens. It's also now avidly used as a promotional platform by many celebrities and media firms, and its parent is reportedly aiming for at least $300 million in 2016 revenue.\nBy creating a platform where shared content by and large isn't saved, and where users don't have to worry about likes and comments, Snap has carved out a unique social media and messaging niche and become a thorn in Facebook's (FB - Get Report) side, particularly among younger consumers.\nIf it's able to reach lower price points, win over third-party hardware makers and sidestep the privacy and image concerns that have plagued Alphabet's (GOOGL - Get Report) Google Glass, Spectacles could provide another means of expanding Snap's reach.\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB or GOOGL? Learn more now.\nLimited as they are right now, Spectacles fulfill one of the goals Google Glass has long had: To let users do things they typically rely on a smartphone for while keeping both of their hands free. As the WSJ writers, \"as you record, your hands are free to pet dogs, hug babies or flail around at a concert. You can reach your arms out to people you're filming, instead of holding your phone up, as Spiegel describes it, 'like a wall in front of your face.'\"\nMoreover, Snap is going to great lengths to avoid having Spectacles viewed as a product for geeks, the way Glass has been -- just see this YouTube video for the glasses if you need proof.\nAt the same time, just as Glass has sought to do much more than record photos and video, Spiegel hints Spectacles could have a larger set of use cases (accessing information? conducting e-commerce transactions?) if they become widely adopted as an image-recording tool.\nUnlike Google with Glass, Snap is taking a bottoms-up approach to the wearables market, creating a cheap, simple device that can take over a core smartphone feature and potentially expanding its feature set in time.\nThe company's decision to simultaneously rename itself Snap is also telling. In addition to providing a more serious-sounding corporate moniker ahead of an expected IPO, the former Snapchat's new name points to a future where the company sees itself less as a provider of ephemeral messaging apps than as a provider of solutions for sharing what people see in the world around them via camera lenses.\nFacebook, which depends so heavily on the photo and video sharing of its users to drive engagement, and whose", "baseline_completion": " attempts to create rivals to Snapchat have failed to date, has to be watching carefully.

{"idx": 541, "truncated_input": "In the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nA former Turkish diplomat told me that during a visit to the Pentagon after 9/11, a top official explained that the Bush Administration hoped Ankara would take steps towards strengthening political and military ties with New Delhi, as part of a process that could lead eventually to the establishment of an alliance between the three pro-Western democracies of India, Turkey and Israel.\nThe Turkish official was dumbfounded. Where was his counterpart getting his political intelligence from? After all, it wasn\u2019t a secret that when it came to the conflict between India and Pakistan, Turkey tended to identify and cooperate with the South Asian Muslim country.\nNo to mention the fact that notwithstanding the partnership between Ankara and Jerusalem, the Turks never considered Israel to be an \u201cally,\u201d as they attempted balancing their relationship with the Jewish State and the Arab countries. In fact, Israel and Turkey didn\u2019t establish full diplomatic until 1992 following the Oslo Process that led to the rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nAnd in any case, the idea of Turkey siding with India and challenging the balance of power in South Asia didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, particularly at a moment when the United States as part of its campaign against terrorism was strengthening its ties with Islamabad and elevating them to the status of a strategic alliance.\nBut then it seemed that Pentagon official was engaged in one of the intellectual exercises favored by both neoconservatives on the political right and liberal internationalists on the political left: Drawing up foreign policy narratives that reflect the dualistic cosmology of Manichaeism in which international relations is seen as a never-ending struggle between light and darkness, between the forces of good led by the United States that are confronting the bad guys, ranging from \u201crogue states\u201d to \u201cauthoritarian regimes\u201d that threaten to destroy the liberal international order.\nBut in the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nSo you need to make sure that while constructing a narrative one takes into account the \u201canomalies\u201d and resolve the cognitive dissonance between the plot of the fairy tale and the many shades of gray that typify the relations between nations.\nHence, when the Bush Administration responded to the attacks on New York and Washington by Al Qaeda, the radical Muslim fundamentalist group, by launching the war against terrorism it identified Iraq and Iran as two of the leading members of the Axis of Evil it was planning to confront.\nBut that proposed narrative was full with inconsistencies. The secular Ba\u2019ath regime in Baghdad and the Shiite clerics in Tehran regarded Osama Bin Ladin\u2019s terrorist group as well as its ally, the Taliban, the Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement ruling Afghanistan as ideological adversaries (in the case of the secular and semi-fascist Saddam Hussein) or as sectarian foes (in the case of Iran\u2019s Ayatollahs).\nOn the other hand, two of Washington\u2019s allies in the war on terrorism, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, were the two main allies of the Taliban while Al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were proponents of the extremist Wahhabi Muslim dogma promoted by the Saudis and embraced by the Pakistanis.\nThe neocons that championed the Bush Administration\u2019s move to oust Saddam Hussein and invade Iraq were never able to resolve this dissonance. They tried to protect it by turning \u201cIslamo-Fascism\u201d into the an all encompassing bogeyman that seemed to cover all the bad guys \u2013 Saddam and the Ayatollahs; Al Qaeda and Hizbolah; the Taliban and Hamas\u2013 while not dwelling on the role of that the Saudis and the Pakistan had played in the story.\nThey even provided the narrative with a Happy End \u2013 the ushering of the age of liberal democracy in the Middle East though the use of American military power. That the story ended with a stronger Iran, the rise of Islamic State (IS), and the return of the Taliban: well that would have to wait for another narrative.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the same cast of narrative writers in Washington who were responsible for that foreign policy flop, are now trying to employ their creative talents to come-up with new story lines that would help convince us that once again the international system was dominated by a struggle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. And guess which side we are on?\nFor a while it seemed as though the reality of international relations was anything but Manichean, with the Middle East degenerating into a struggle over power between a few allies (Turkey; the Kurds; Israel); not very-nice players who happen to be our friends (Saudi Arabia; Egypt); the bad ones (Iran; Syria; Hizbolah; Hamas), and the devil incarnate (IS) that happened to be a killing machine that owes its radical Islamist ideology to the Wahhabi teachers in Saudi Arabia. Not to mention Al Qaeda and its many political satellites that were located now somewhere between the bad ones and the devil incarnate.\nThat was kind of a bummer, if you plan to write a script for a western in which the noble protagonists fight the evil antagonists, as opposed to a post-modern David Lynch movie with its tormenting moral ambiguity, which unfortunately is how the international system looks quite frequently.\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and West was encouraging in a sense that it helped to cast Vladimir Putin as the new global villain. That Putin strengthened Russia\u2019s ties with its old client state Syria and maintained friendly ties with Iran, allowed the creative juices of the narrative writers to start flowing again and to identify the new forces of darkness: The authoritarian Putin; the murderous Bashar Assad; and the Ayatollahs in Tehran.\nNever mind that the secular Assad and for that matter, Iran, were fighting the IS and other radical Sunni Islamist groups. Or that Russia had to protect legitimate strategic interests in the Middle East and was strengthening its ties with a U.S. ally, Israel. Or that Turkey was at one point allied with Assad, that it was an adversary of the Kurds and in the midst of a major diplomatic confrontation with Israel, and that together with the Saudis, Ankara helped support radical Sunni Islamist groups.\nIndeed, it was becoming more and more difficult to cast Turkey\u2019s Recap Tayyip Erdogan, who like Putin was accused of projecting authoritarian tendencies, as the good guy in the evolving narrative, especially after the Turks shot-down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria in November 2015, raising the specter of a war between the Russians and the Turks.\nBut not to worry: Amid the tensions between Ankara and the West in the aftermath of the attempted military coup in Turkey, and as the two countries struggled with their flagging economies, Moscow and Ankara decided to patch their relations, leading to a meeting between Erdogan and Putin in Moscow.\nJudging by the reaction of the foreign policy crowd in Washington, the meeting was nothing short of an historic summit, a turning point in the Middle East politics that could reshape the global balance of balance: The supposedly two anti-Eastern authoritarian leaders, are cooperating with the other force of darkness, Iran, in shoring up Assad brutal regime and check mating the United States.\nIt almost goes without saying that this storyline is farfetched when one takes into consideration that Turkey is an important member of NATO and is seeking membership in the European Union (EU). Just count how many times President Barack Obama has met with Erdogan. And Turkey (like in the case of Russia), continues to hold free and democratic elections (certainly more open than those held in \u201cliberated\u201d Iraq or in Egypt).\nThere is no question that there are serious disagreements between the U.S. and Turkey \u2013 as there are between Russia and Turkey or between the Russia and the United States --", "baseline_completion": " over the strategy of bringing an end to the civil war in Syria as well as over Kurdish issue.

{"idx": 542, "truncated_input": "Revolve Clothing, an increasingly popular Los Angeles-based fashion e-commerce business, is the latest such retailer to fall victim to layoffs, even as the company\u2019s profits continue to grow. Earlier this month, Revolve announced a round of layoffs in the photo department of its Cerritos headquarters, and sources who spoke to Jezebel believe the company\u2019s seemingly endless budget for mega influencer events\u2014including a Kim Kardashian appearance in the Hamptons\u2014may be coming at the expense of those jobs.\nTwo Revolve employees (both spoke to me over the phone under the condition of anonymity to avoid penalty) said Revolve co-founder Mike Karanikolas held a meeting on June 17 and announced that the company was laying off the majority of its photo editing team\u2014which is responsible for acquiring and editing photos and editorials that appear on the site\u2014to save on operational costs.\nOne staff member also said people who lost their jobs were offered severance packages that will only be issued if they remain at Revolve until their official termination date, which is months down the line. Some employees will stay on until September, while others will remain until November or January, after which their jobs will be outsourced to workers in another country (two employees, one current and one former, specifically said the Philippines). Employees appear to be cautious about publicly discussing the layoffs to avoid jeopardizing their future severance.\nIn June, we notified a small number of employees that they will likely be let go between the months of September and January, as we shift certain work to a 3rd party provider. All affected employees were provided at least several months advance notice, and all were additionally provided severance packages including salary and health coverage, as well as assistance locating other career opportunities. While fewer than ten employees were affected by the changes, we sympathize with their situation, and are doing our best to assist them going forward.\nWe don\u2019t anticipate any other operational changes of this nature and the company will continue to hire and build the team as the business continues to grow.\nExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE, which employs hundreds of individuals. We generally do not comment on marketing expenditures, but we will say in this case the information reported by the press was inaccurate.\nThe inaccuracy she\u2019s referring to are reports that Kim Kardashian was paid $700,000 to host a Revolve Hamptons event this summer. According to the laid-off employees I spoke to, it\u2019s the optics of excess spending that make the layoffs feel more offensive. Perhaps what\u2019s happening is an overlap of their personal disappointment about losing a job and the natural effects of a company that\u2019s prioritizing public image.\nStill, like other fashion outlets, Revolve relies heavily on celebrities and influencers for a marketing boost. Nicole Richie collaborated on a line, stars like Kendall and Kylie Jenner have sold a collection on their site, and style bloggers are frequently sent on trips to promote the brand. Such events have become the lifeblood of Revolve.\nIn addition to taking care of their travel and accommodations, Revolve gifted each influencer with a sizable clothing credit \u2014 a source close to the participating talent tells us $2,000 is standard \u2014 in addition to paying his or her appearance fee. And for certain agency-backed bloggers, like Bernstein and Bazan, who are both represented by Next Models, this can easily run in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe first Revolve employee I spoke to who was part of the layoffs told me the company\u2019s decision to hire Kardashian angered staff members who\u2019d been let go. Kim reportedly spent an hour at the party, where she was seen \u201ctaking numerous selfies with influencers,\u201d Page Six reported.\nAlso in attendance were fashion insiders like stylist Chriselle Lim, blogger Arielle Charnas and DJ Amy Pham.\nGerona responded to my question about the Kardashian event in her email above with: \u201cExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE.\u201d Gerona also declined to comment on how much Kardashian was paid for the event.\nWhy the huge cost for Kardashian\u2019s brief appearance? It\u2019s all part of Revolve\u2019s big picture marketing strategy to show clothes in context so customers aspire to wear them \u2014 and in turn, buy them. (Google recently released a study that found this tactic influences 64 percent of women to make a purchase on their smartphones.) When the brand isn\u2019t hosting parties in the Hamptons, it\u2019s sending fashion bloggers on epic, scenic trips around the world \u2014 Jamaica, Mexico, Croatia, etc. \u2014 dressed in the e-tailer\u2019s latest offerings.\nThe employee estimated that the average photo editor\u2019s salary at Revolve is around $36,000. Some of the laid-off staffers first heard about the Kardashian appearance when a fed-up ex-employee railed about it in a scathing Instagram post and tweet posted on July 19.\nWhen I spoke to Estrada over the phone, he said the photo editing team at Revolve is responsible for \u201cpretty much about 95 percent of the website\u201d and that employees who were laid off but still working\u2014some of whom he\ufffd", "baseline_completion": "\ufffds remained friends with and have expressed grievances to him, he says\u2014have been tasked with making the outsourcing a smooth transition.\nWhen asked whether the recent layoffs could simply be viewed as a common, unfortunate result of a growing company\u2019s bureaucratic decisions, Estrada noted that cost-cutting could have been directed elsewhere.\nUPDATE (3:40 p.m.): This post has been updated with additional comments from Revolve\u2019s brand and marketing rep Raissa Gerona.", "orig_sample_length": 1224, "prompt_length": 1124, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": "\ufffdd known for years\u2014were \u201cpretty upset.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the reasoning is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of a shame.\u201d\nRevolve\u2019s stock price has been on a tear since the company went public in May, and the company\u2019s revenue has grown by more than 50 percent in the past year.

{"idx": 545, "truncated_input": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is opposed to even limited U.S. military intervention in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad regime wouldn't support American interests if they were to seize power right now, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to a congressman in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.\nEffectively ruling out U.S. cruise missile attacks and other options that wouldn't require U.S. troops on the ground, Dempsey said the military is clearly capable of taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the Arab country's 2 1/2-year war back toward the armed opposition. But he said such an approach would plunge the United States deep into another war in the Arab world and offer no strategy for peace in a nation plagued by ethnic rivalries.\n\"Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,\" Dempsey said in the letter Aug. 19 to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.\"\nDempsey's pessimistic assessment will hardly please members of the fractured Syrian opposition leadership and some members of the administration who have championed greater support to help the rebellion end Assad's four-decade family dynasty. Despite almost incessant bickering and internal disputes, some opposition groups have worked with the United States and other European and Arab supporters to try to form a cohesive, inclusive movement dedicated to a democratic and multiethnic state.\nBut those fighting the Assad government range wildly in political and ethnic beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.\nAs the conflict has gone on, killing more than 100,000 people and ripping apart the delicate sectarian fabric of Syrian society, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad regime has committed. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.\nDempsey said Syria's war was \"tragic and complex.\"\n\"It is a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions, and violent struggles for power will continue after Assad's rule ends,\" he wrote. \"We should evaluate the effectiveness of limited military options in this context.\"\nOn Wednesday, two Syrian pro-opposition groups claimed that government forces carried out a \"poisonous gas\" attack near the capital, Damascus, leaving dozens of people dead. There was no government comment on the claims and the reports could not be independently confirmed.\nDespite calling for Assad to leave power in 2011, President Barack Obama has steadfastly refused to allow the U.S. to be drawn directly into the conflict. Officials have said for the past couple of months, however, that the U.S. is prepared to provide lethal aid to vetted, moderate units among the opposition ranks. It's unclear what, if any, weapons have been delivered so far.\nDempsey's letter to Engel was another follow-up to a sharp examination he faced in July from the Senate Armed Services Committee ahead of a reconfirmation vote. Unable to answer questions by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Dempsey sent a letter afterward saying the establishment of a no-fly zone to protect the Syrian rebels would require hundreds of U.S. aircraft at a cost as much as $1 billion a month and with no assurance that it would change the war's momentum.\nHe also discouraged options such as training vetted rebel groups, limited strikes on Syria's air defenses and creating a buffer zone for the opposition, stressing the need to avoid an outcome similar to Iraq or Afghanistan by preserving a functioning state for any future power transfer. And he cited risks such as lost U.S. aircraft.\nEngel, another advocate of more forceful U.S. action, joined the debate by proposing the use of cruise missiles and other weapons against Syrian government-controlled air bases in an Aug. 5 letter to Dempsey. The congressman said such strikes would ground Assad's air force and reduce the flow of weapons to his government from Iran and Russia, while costing less to U.S. taxpayers and requiring no American troops on the ground in Syria or in its airspace.\nDempsey said this approach wouldn't tip the balance against Assad and wouldn't solve the deeper problems plaguing Syria.\n\"We can destroy the Syrian air force,\" he said. \"The loss of Assad's air force would negate his ability to attack opposition forces from the air, but it would also escalate and potentially further commit the United States to the conflict. Stated another way, it would not be militarily decisive, but it would commit us decisively to the conflict.\"\n\"The use of U.S.", "baseline_completion": " military force can change the military balance,\" Dempsey added. \"But it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict.\"\nInstead, he spoke in favor of an expansion of the Obama administration's current policy.\nThe U.S. can provide far greater humanitarian assistance and, if asked, do more to bolster a moderate opposition in Syria.

The four schools include Roxbury Community College, Bay Path University in Longmeadow, Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley and the Urban College of Boston.\nThe new recipients are part of a more than $1.4 million grant pool to 82 schools across the country. Delivered in partnership with the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative, the grants build upon the three organizations' combined commitment to helping deliver a tobacco-free generation.\nThe funding announced today will help accelerate and expand the number of campuses across the country that prohibit smoking, e-cigarette, and other tobacco product use. While conventional cigarette smoking among high school students has fallen by almost 50 percent since 2011, e-cigarette use has surged over the last year, especially among young people\u2014there are 2.8 million young adults aged 18-24 who are current e-cigarette users. The spread of e-cigarettes risks a reversal of the progress made in reducing smoking over the last two decades given that young people who vape are four times more likely to begin smoking cigarettes in the future.\n\"A critical goal in building healthier communities across the country is reducing tobacco-use, which remains one of the leading causes of preventable death in this country,\" said Eileen Howard Boone, President of the CVS Health Foundation. \"By helping more colleges and universities explore and execute on tobacco-free policies, we're able to positively influence the number of new college-age smokers and get one step closer to our goal of seeing the first tobacco-free generation.\"\nThe grants are part of Be The First, CVS Health's five-year, $50 million initiative to deliver the nation's first tobacco-free generation, which is a major program within the company's new $100 million Building Healthier Communities initiative. While the number of U.S. colleges and universities that are smoke- or tobacco-free has doubled since 2012, approximately half of the nearly 5,000 schools across the country still have no comprehensive policy in place.\nWith the CVS Health Foundation's support, the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative programs help students, faculty and staff develop and execute strategies that are customized to meet the unique needs of each campus and move the schools toward a 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free environment. Together, the organizations have provided financial and technical support to more than 200 colleges and universities since 2016, helping to clear the air for more than one million students.\n\"While the teen smoking rate has fallen to an all-time low of 4.6 percent, the rapid rise in e-cigarette use threatens to erase this progress given youth who vape are four times more likely to progress to smoking deadly cigarettes,\" said Robin Koval, CEO and President of Truth Initiative. \"Over the years, we've had great success in working with colleges to go smoke- and tobacco-free. They now play a critical role in also addressing the e-cigarette epidemic as vaping becomes even more prevalent on campuses across the U.S. Together with our partners, we look forward to empowering as many colleges and universities as possible with the information and resources they need to end all tobacco use for good.\"\n\"Cigarettes cause more than 480,000 U.S. deaths annually and are responsible for nearly 29 percent of all cancer deaths in the U.S.,\" said Gary Reedy, CEO of the American Cancer Society. \"College is a time when young adults are susceptible to developing or perpetuating an addiction to nicotine and tobacco. This partnership continues to enable us to help reduce tobacco use among college students and therefore reduce the number of people impacted by tobacco-related diseases.\"\nTo see the full list of colleges supported by these grants and for more information on the grant application process, please visit http://www.cvshealth.com/smartcampusesquit.\nCVS Health is the nation's premier health innovation company helping people on their path to better health.

{"idx": 549, "truncated_input": "Subarus are very popular in New England. So how do three crossovers \u2013 the Outback, Crosstrek, and Forester \u2013 stack up against each other?\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a smallish SUV or crossover (those terms have become pretty much interchangeable these days), choosing which brands to compare is one challenge.\nBut what if you\u2019ve already picked your brand? We have. Today\u2019s column explains the differences among Subaru\u2019s three crossover offerings.\nWhy Subaru? Because it\u2019s the ultimate New England fallback for the region\u2019s winter climate.\nMost folks reading this know a bit about Subarus; namely, that they: 1) are a popular vehicle in New England; 2) last a long time; 3) have a time-tested all-wheel-drive system; 4) and all look somewhat alike.\nBut ask those same folks to describe the differences among the Outback, Forester, and XV CrossTtrek, and you\u2019re liable to get a blank stare.\nMo\u00acst of us recognize the models, but are hard-pressed to single out what\u2019s distinctive about each one.\nThe differences are real. The Outback is longer, the Forester is higher and has a higher cargo area, especially important if you\u2019ve got a good-sized dog, and the XV CrossTrek definitely has an edgy, more aggressive look, in large part because of its fancy wheels. It\u2019s also the only one that comes in tangerine orange, a color that definitely goes outside the Subaru mainstream.\nHere\u2019s a capsule look at each vehicle, replete with random tangential thoughts. We\u2019re comparing the three, each in mid-range premium trim with the CVT transmission.\nFrankly, because it looks like a second cousin to a Volvo SUV, we thought the Outback was the smallest member of the family. Actually, it happens to be the longest, fitting into the midsize crossover category. It\u2019s got a longer wheelbase (by 4-plus inches) than the other two and is significantly longer overall (189.6 inches compared to 180.9 for the Forester and 175.2 for the XV Crosstrek). It\u2019s also wider than the others (72.4 inches compared to 70.7 for the Forester and 70.1 for the XV Crosstrek).\nThe Outback also happens to be Subaru\u2019s No. 1 seller. In our comparison trim, it has a price of $27,845.\nEven though it has a more aerodynamic appearance, the Outback has the most cubic feet of cargo space with 73.3 compared to 68.5 for the Forester and 51.9 for the Crosstrek.\nThe Outback isn\u2019t available with a manual transmission, but it is the only one of the three you can get with a six-cylinder engine\u2014the 3.6-liter optional offering.\nFor techies, the new Outback is available with (meaning at extra cost) the second-generation of Subaru\u2019s award-winning (top Safety pick+) Eyesight system with adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, pre-collision braking, rear cross-traffic alert, and blind spot warning. Drive with this system for a week and there\u2019s no going back.\nThe basic Outback shares the same 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with the Forester but, for some reason, gets 175 horsepower compared to the Forester\u2019s 170.\nThe Forester and XV Crosstrek are built on the same platform. They have basically the same 103-inch wheelbase and share the same car-based platform. However, the Crosstrek is more than 5 inches shorter overall.\nBoth fit into the compact crossover category; however, the Forester has a maximum cargo space (with rear seats folded) of 68.5 cubic feet compared to the Crosstrek\u2019s 51.9 cubic feet.\nAlso, while they both have Subaru\u2019s CVT transmission, the Forester has a bigger 2.5-liter engine with 170 horsepower compared to the XV Crosstrek\u2019s 2.0-liter with 148 hp.\nSubaru people say the Forester is more of a family car (for a small family) and the most dog-friendly (a big Subaru talking point) because its higher roofline lets larger dogs sit upright.\nIn our mid-range configuration, the Forester has an MSRP of $25,945. That\u2019s almost $2,000 less than the Outback, which does have more standard features.\nThe Forester also offers a massive optional moonroof. Visibility for the driver arguably is as good as any vehicle on the market.\nFor those who haven\u2019t given in and conceded that CVTs offer better fuel economy than manual transmissions, the Forester still can be had with a manual.\nIt\u2019s cool. It\u2019s sporty. It\u2019s more aggressively styled. It\u2019s less expensive.\nWhile the Forester might be a better choice for a family, the Crosstrek is a great choice for a single person or a couple.\nFor a crossover, it has impressive fuel economy figures of 26 city and 34 highway.\nIts shorter length makes it easier to park.\nLike all three of our Subarus, it has 8.7 inches of ground clearance. In a year when we\u2019ve had more than 100 inches of snow, it\u2019s nice to know that if this 3,000-plus pound car can pack the snow", "baseline_completion": " down to 9 inches, it can go most anyplace.\nThe XV Crosstrek\u2019s price is $24,145 in a similar premium configuration, making it a good choice if you don\u2019t need the size of the Outback or the squarer configuration of the Forester.\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line? Simple. You can\u2019t go wrong with any of these Subarus, but this comparison may help you decide which best fits your lifestyle.", "orig_sample_length": 1291, "prompt_length": 1191, "baseline_completion_length": 100, "no_wm_output": ", the Crosstrek can.\nThe Crosstrek is available with a manual transmission.\nThe XV Crosstrek is the only one of the three that comes with a CVT transmission.\nThe XV Crosstrek is the only one of the three that comes with a manual transmission.\nThe XV Crosstrek is the only one of the three that comes with a CVT transmission.\nThe XV Crosstrek is the only one of the three that comes with a CVT", "w_wm_output": ", it\u2019ll be fine.\nIt\u2019s also available with Subaru\u2019s EyeSight suite of advanced driver-assistance features.
